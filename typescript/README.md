# TypeScript (new)

This directory is for the new TypeScript implementation and tooling.

Legacy TypeScript code lives in `typescript-legacy/`.

## Subject

The compliance suite runs a per-language **subject** (implementation under test) via `SUBJECT_CMD`.

For TypeScript, we will provide a runnable subject here (placeholder for now).
