# Swift (new)

This directory is for the new Swift implementation and tooling.

Legacy Swift code lives in `swift-legacy/`.

## Subject

The compliance suite runs a per-language **subject** (implementation under test) via `SUBJECT_CMD`.

For Swift, we will provide a runnable subject here (placeholder for now).
