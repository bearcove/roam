/// Rapace Runtime for Swift
///
/// Core runtime library for Rapace RPC services.
/// Provides binary encoding, postcard serialization, and dispatch primitives.
///
/// Service-specific code (method IDs, client stubs, dispatch maps) should be
/// generated by codegen, not hand-written. This package provides only the
/// runtime components that are common across all services.

import Foundation

// Re-export all public APIs
// (Swift automatically exports public symbols from the module)
