//! Message transport abstraction.
//!
//! This module defines the [`MessageTransport`] trait that abstracts over different
//! transport mechanisms for sending and receiving roam messages.
//!
//! Implementations:
//! - `LengthPrefixedFramed` from `roam-stream` for byte streams (TCP, Unix sockets) - native only
//! - `WsTransport` from `roam-websocket` for WebSocket (native and WASM)

/// This abstracts over the framing mechanism:
/// - Byte streams need length-prefixed framing to delimit messages
/// - Message-oriented transports (WebSocket) have built-in framing
///
/// Both cases share the same protocol logic in the Driver.
///
/// # Platform-specific Send bounds
///
/// On native (tokio), the trait and its async methods require `Send` for
/// multi-threaded executors. On WASM, everything is single-threaded so
/// `Send` bounds are not required.
