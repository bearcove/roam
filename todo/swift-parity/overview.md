# Swift Implementation Parity

## Goal

Bring the Swift implementation up to parity with Rust and TypeScript in terms of:
- Schema-driven serialization/deserialization
- Channel binding
- Connection logic
- Code generation from `roam-codegen`
- Spec compliance (tracey rule coverage)

## Current State (Updated after Phase 001)

The Swift implementation is **more complete than originally estimated**:

| Component | Rust | TypeScript | Swift | Notes |
|-----------|------|------------|-------|-------|
| Postcard primitives | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| Wire protocol | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All variants |
| COBS framing | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| SwiftNIO transport | N/A | N/A | ✅ | Working |
| Channel types (Tx/Rx) | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Actor-based |
| Channel registry | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| Driver/Connection | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Working |
| **Code generation** | N/A | ✅ | ✅ | **Functional!** |
| **Schema types** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Schema-driven encode** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Schema-driven decode** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Channel binding** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Client stubs** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Server dispatcher** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | Generated |
| **Spec rule coverage** | 80% | 47% | 0% | No annotations yet |
| **Golden vector tests** | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | All pass |

### Spec Test Results

| Category | Pass | Fail | Notes |
|----------|------|------|-------|
| Protocol tests | 7/7 | 0 | All pass |
| Testbed (unary) | 4/4 | 0 | All pass |
| Client mode | 3/3 | 0 | All pass |
| Streaming | 3/3 | 0 | All pass |
| **Total** | **17/17** | **0** | **100% pass rate** |

## Completed Phases

| Phase | File | Status | Description |
|-------|------|--------|-------------|
| 001 | [001-DONE-assess-swift-baseline.md](./001-DONE-assess-swift-baseline.md) | **DONE** | Audit, found codegen works |
| 002 | [002-DONE-fix-streaming.md](./002-DONE-fix-streaming.md) | **DONE** | Fixed Postcard varint decoding |

## Remaining Work

| Phase | Status | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 003 | TODO | Add tracey spec annotations to Swift code |

**Phases 002-012 from original plan are obsolete** — codegen already works!

## Architecture

### How Swift Works (code generation)

```
roam-codegen (Rust)
        │
        ▼
Generated Swift (Testbed.swift):
  - Type definitions (structs, enums)
  - Schema constants
  - Encode/decode functions
  - Client stubs with channel binding
  - Server dispatcher with preregistration
        │
        ▼
Runtime (roam-runtime):
  - Postcard primitives
  - Wire protocol
  - Channel types (Tx/Rx)
  - Driver event loop
  - SwiftNIO transport
```

## Files

### Swift Runtime
- `swift/roam-runtime/Sources/RoamRuntime/` — Core runtime (working)
- `swift/roam-runtime/Tests/RoamRuntimeTests/` — 39 tests (all pass)

### Swift Subject  
- `swift/subject/Sources/subject-swift/Subject.swift` — Handler implementation
- `swift/subject/Sources/subject-swift/Testbed.swift` — Generated code

### Rust Codegen
- `rust/roam-codegen/src/targets/swift/` — Swift code generation (working)
  - `mod.rs` — Entry point
  - `types.rs` — Type generation
  - `schema.rs` — Schema constants
  - `encode.rs` — Encode expressions
  - `decode.rs` — Decode expressions
  - `client.rs` — Client stubs
  - `server.rs` — Server dispatcher

## Commands

```bash
# Run Swift runtime tests
cd swift/roam-runtime && swift test

# Build Swift subject
cd swift/subject && swift build -c release

# Run spec tests with Swift subject
SUBJECT_CMD="./swift/subject/.build/release/subject-swift" cargo test -p spec-tests

# Enable wire spy for debugging
ROAM_WIRE_SPY=1 SUBJECT_CMD="./swift/subject/.build/release/subject-swift" cargo test -p spec-tests

# Generate Swift code
cargo xtask codegen --swift
```

## Success Criteria

1. ✅ Swift golden vector tests pass (39/39)
2. ✅ Swift subject builds and runs
3. ✅ All 17 spec tests pass (100%)
4. ✅ All streaming tests pass
5. ⏳ Tracey annotations added (Phase 003)

## Estimated Remaining Effort

| Phase | Complexity | Est. Time |
|-------|------------|-----------|
| 003 Spec Annotations | Low | 2-3 hours |
| **Total** | | **2-3 hours** |

Swift parity is essentially complete. Only tracey annotations remain.
