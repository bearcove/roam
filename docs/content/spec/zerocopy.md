# Zero-copy data flow

r[zerocopy]

Roam aims to minimize copies at every layer. This document specifies how
payloads flow through the system — from user code, through serialization
and transport, to deserialization on the other side — and which link types
enable zero-copy at each stage.

## Backing storage

r[zerocopy.backing]

A **Backing** is an owned handle that keeps a region of bytes alive. The
receive path deserializes borrowing from a Backing, producing values that
may contain `&str` or `&[u8]` pointing into the original buffer.

r[zerocopy.backing.boxed]

**Boxed** — a heap-allocated `Box<[u8]>`. Used by stream (TCP) and
WebSocket links after reading into an owned buffer.

r[zerocopy.backing.bipbuf]

**BipBuf** — a region inside a shared-memory BipBuffer. For small messages
that fit inline in the ring, the receiver borrows directly from the ring
and returns the region when done.

r[zerocopy.backing.varslot]

**VarSlot** — a slot in a shared-memory VarSlotPool. For medium messages,
the sender writes into a variable-size slot and the receiver borrows from
it. The slot is returned to the pool when the Backing is dropped.

r[zerocopy.backing.mmap]

**Mmap** — a memory-mapped region for large payloads. The sender writes a
file (or anonymous mapping), the receiver maps it and borrows from the
mapping.

## Send path

r[zerocopy.send]

On the send side, user code provides a value to serialize. The value may
borrow from the calling context.

### Borrowed arguments

r[zerocopy.send.borrowed]

A call like `client.method(&buf[..12]).await` passes a borrowed slice.
The future returned by `method()` captures the reference. The caller's
`.await` keeps the borrow alive for the future's entire lifetime —
including across yield points (e.g. `reserve()` for backpressure).

r[zerocopy.send.borrowed-in-struct]

A call like `client.method(Context { name: &my_string }).await` passes a
struct that borrows from the calling scope. This is valid for the same
reason: the future captures the struct, which holds the borrow, and the
caller's `.await` keeps everything alive until the future completes.

r[zerocopy.send.lifetime]

The send future is not `'static` — it borrows from the caller's scope.
This means it cannot be spawned on executors that require `'static`
futures (e.g. `tokio::spawn`). It is driven to
completion by the caller's `.await`, which guarantees all borrows remain
valid. The actual sequence is:

1. The future calls `reserve().await` — yields until the link has capacity
2. The future calls `alloc(len)` — obtains a write slot
3. The future serializes the borrowed value into the write slot
4. The future calls `commit()` — publishes the bytes

Serialization happens in step 3, after the backpressure yield. The
borrowed data is valid because the caller is still awaiting.

### Link-specific send behavior

r[zerocopy.send.stream]

**Stream links (TCP):** serialize into a write buffer, flush to socket.
One copy (value → write buffer).

r[zerocopy.send.websocket]

**WebSocket links:** serialize into a message buffer, send as a WebSocket
frame. One copy (value → message buffer).

r[zerocopy.send.shm]

**SHM links:** the send path depends on payload size:

- **Small (`8 + payload_len <= inline_threshold`):** serialize directly into the
  BipBuffer ring. `LinkTx::alloc` returns a `WriteSlot` pointing into
  the ring.
- **Medium (`8 + payload_len > inline_threshold` and
  `payload_len <= mmap_threshold`):** serialize
  into a VarSlot. `LinkTx::alloc` allocates a slot and returns a
  `WriteSlot` pointing into it. A slot-ref frame is written to the
  BipBuffer to notify the receiver.
- **Large (`payload_len > mmap_threshold`):** serialize into a memory-mapped
  region. A reference to the mapping is sent through the BipBuffer.

In all cases, serialization writes directly into shared memory. Zero
copies for the payload bytes — the receiver reads from the same physical
memory.
`mmap_threshold` is defined by the SHM transport as the largest payload
that fits in any VarSlotPool class (see [SHM spec](@/spec/shm.md)).

## Receive path

r[zerocopy.recv]

On the receive side, `LinkRx::recv` returns a `Backing` that keeps raw
bytes alive. For heap-backed links the Backing owns the buffer; for SHM
links it holds a handle (BipBuf region, VarSlot, or mmap) that keeps the
underlying shared memory valid until dropped. The conduit
deserializes borrowing from this backing, producing a `SelfRef<T>` that
pairs the decoded value with its backing.

r[zerocopy.recv.selfref]

`SelfRef<T>` guarantees correct drop order: the decoded value is dropped
before its backing storage. This allows the value to contain references
(`&str`, `&[u8]`) pointing into the backing without use-after-free.

### Link-specific receive behavior

r[zerocopy.recv.stream]

**Stream links (TCP):** `recv` reads a length-prefixed frame into a
`Box<[u8]>`. One copy (socket → heap). Deserialization borrows from the
box.

r[zerocopy.recv.websocket]

**WebSocket links:** `recv` receives a complete message as `bytes::Bytes`,
converted to `Box<[u8]>`. One copy at the Roam link boundary (transport-
internal buffering is not counted). Deserialization borrows from the box.

r[zerocopy.recv.shm.inline]

**SHM links (inline):** for messages where
`8 + payload_len <= inline_threshold`, `recv`
returns a Backing that borrows from the BipBuffer ring. Zero copies —
deserialization reads directly from shared memory.

r[zerocopy.recv.shm.slotref]

**SHM links (slot-ref):** for messages where
`8 + payload_len > inline_threshold` and `payload_len <= mmap_threshold`,
`recv` returns a Backing
that borrows from a VarSlot. Zero copies — deserialization reads from the
slot, which is returned to the pool when the Backing drops.

r[zerocopy.recv.shm.mmap]

**SHM links (mmap):** for messages where `payload_len > mmap_threshold`,
`recv` maps the region and
returns a Backing that owns the mapping. Zero copies — deserialization
reads from the mapping.

## Framing layers

r[zerocopy.framing]

A message passes through three layers of framing between user code and
the physical wire. Each layer has a distinct responsibility.

### Layer 1: Value encoding

r[zerocopy.framing.value]

The user's Rust value is serialized using postcard (via facet-postcard).
Postcard produces a compact binary encoding that supports zero-copy
deserialization — string and byte slice fields can borrow directly from
the input buffer.

The output of this layer is a contiguous byte sequence representing the
serialized value.

r[zerocopy.framing.value.opaque]

For `Message<'payload>` payload fields marked as opaque, value encoding is
the boundary where erased payload behavior is applied:

- **Outgoing (`Message<'call>`):** the opaque adapter maps the payload to
  `(PtrConst, Shape, Option<TypePlanCore>)`, and postcard serializes that
  mapped value.
- **Incoming (`Message<'static>` inside `SelfRef`):** postcard decodes the
  payload byte sequence and materializes deferred payload state as either a
  borrowed byte slice (when input backing is stable) or owned bytes.

Conduit framing and link framing do not change this mapping contract; they
only add/remove their own framing around the same encoded payload bytes.

### Layer 2: Conduit framing

r[zerocopy.framing.conduit]

The conduit wraps the serialized value bytes depending on the conduit
type:

r[zerocopy.framing.conduit.bare]

**BareConduit** — no additional framing. The serialized value bytes are
passed directly to the link. Suitable for transports where reliability
is inherent or unnecessary (shared memory, in-process, localhost).

r[zerocopy.framing.conduit.stable]

**StableConduit** — serializes a `Frame<T>` instead of a bare `T`. The
Frame struct contains:

- `seq: u32` — monotonically increasing sequence number
- `ack: Option<u32>` — highest sequence number received from the peer
- `item: T` — the actual value

The entire `Frame<T>` is serialized in one postcard pass — there is no
separate header serialization step. The conduit framing fields are just
the first fields of the serialized output. The conduit maintains a
replay buffer of serialized frame bytes for retransmission after
reconnection. Required for transports that may drop the underlying
connection (TCP, WebSocket).

### Layer 3: Link framing

r[zerocopy.framing.link]

The link adds transport-specific framing to preserve message boundaries:

r[zerocopy.framing.link.stream]

**Stream links (TCP, Unix sockets):** 4-byte little-endian length prefix
followed by the payload bytes: `[len: u32 LE][payload]`.

r[zerocopy.framing.link.websocket]

**WebSocket links:** each message is sent as a single binary WebSocket
frame. The WebSocket protocol preserves message boundaries natively.

r[zerocopy.framing.link.shm]

**SHM links:** 8-byte frame header (total_len + flags + reserved)
followed by one of:

- inline payload bytes (padded to 4-byte alignment),
- a 12-byte slot-ref body pointing into the VarSlotPool (`SLOT_REF`), or
- a 24-byte mmap-ref body (`MMAP_REF`) containing mapping identifier,
  generation, offset, and payload length.

See the
[SHM spec](@/spec/shm.md) for details.

r[zerocopy.framing.link.memory]

**Memory links (in-process):** no framing. Messages are `Vec<u8>` passed
through an MPSC channel. Used for testing and in-process communication.

### Framing combinations

r[zerocopy.framing.combinations]

Not all conduit × link combinations are valid or useful:

| Conduit       | Stream | WebSocket | SHM  | Memory |
|---------------|--------|-----------|------|--------|
| BareConduit   | —      | —         | yes  | yes    |
| StableConduit | yes    | yes       | —    | —      |

BareConduit is used with links that don't lose connections (SHM, memory).
StableConduit is used with links that may disconnect (TCP, WebSocket) and
need seq/ack for replay on reconnect.

### End-to-end pipeline and lifetimes

r[zerocopy.framing.pipeline]

The runtime pipeline is:

1. **Link layer** receives/sends framed transport bytes.
2. **Conduit layer** removes/applies conduit framing (`T` vs `Frame<T>`).
3. **Value layer** decodes/encodes `Message<'payload>` fields, including
   opaque payload handling.

r[zerocopy.framing.pipeline.incoming]

Incoming path:

1. `LinkRx::recv` yields `Backing` containing one message payload.
2. Conduit deframes and deserializes into `SelfRef<Message<'static>>`.
3. Driver/dispatch reads `method_id`, resolves concrete args shape/plan, and
   maps `SelfRef<Message<'static>>` to `SelfRef<ConcreteArgs>` using the same
   backing.

r[zerocopy.framing.pipeline.outgoing]

Outgoing path:

1. Driver builds `Message<'call>` borrowing from call scope as needed.
2. Opaque payload mapping happens during value serialization.
3. Conduit applies its framing (`T` or `Frame<T>`), then link applies
   transport framing at commit/send time.

### Serialization timing

r[zerocopy.framing.single-pass]

Despite the three logical layers, serialization happens exactly once.
The conduit is generic over the value type `T`, so:

- **BareConduit** serializes `T` directly into the write slot.
- **StableConduit** serializes `Frame<T>` directly into the write slot.

In both cases, postcard writes the output into the buffer provided by
`LinkTx::alloc`. There is no intermediate buffer between layers — the
value encoding and conduit framing are a single serialization pass, and
the link framing (length prefix, SHM frame header, etc.) is applied by
the link at `commit()` time around the already-written bytes.

r[zerocopy.framing.no-double-serialize]

The conduit MUST NOT serialize the value into a temporary buffer and
then copy it into the write slot. The conduit serializes the value (or
`Frame<T>`) directly into the link's write slot in one pass.

### Scatter/gather serialization

r[zerocopy.scatter]

Serializing directly into the write slot requires knowing the total
encoded size before calling `LinkTx::alloc(len)`. Postcard's encoding
is sequential and deterministic, so the serializer can compute the
exact output size and collect copy instructions without writing to a
final destination buffer.

r[zerocopy.scatter.plan]

The serializer performs a single walk over the value and produces a
**scatter plan**: a staging buffer plus an ordered list of segments.
Each segment is either:

- **Staged** — a byte range within the staging buffer (structural
  bytes: varints, enum tags, length prefixes, fixed-size fields), or
- **Reference** — a pointer and length into the original value's memory
  (blob fields: `&[u8]`, `&str`).

The staging buffer contains only the structural bytes. Blob payloads
are never copied into it — they remain at their original addresses.

r[zerocopy.scatter.plan.size]

The total encoded size is the sum of all segment lengths (staged +
referenced). This is known after the walk completes, before any bytes
are written to the destination.

r[zerocopy.scatter.write]

To write the scatter plan into a destination buffer:

1. Call `LinkTx::alloc(total_size)` to obtain a `WriteSlot`.
2. Walk the segment list in order. For each segment, `memcpy` its bytes
   (from staging buffer or from the referenced source) into the write
   slot at the current offset.
3. Call `commit()` on the write slot.

This is the only point where bytes are copied into the link's buffer.
Blob data goes directly from the caller's memory to the write slot —
one copy total.

r[zerocopy.scatter.lifetime]

The scatter plan borrows from the original value. The plan MUST be
consumed (written into a slot) before the borrows expire. In practice,
the conduit's `send` method builds the plan and writes it within the
same call, while the caller's `.await` keeps all borrows alive (see
`zerocopy.send.lifetime`).

r[zerocopy.scatter.replay]

For StableConduit, the replay buffer needs an owned copy of the
serialized frame bytes. After writing the scatter plan into the write
slot, the conduit copies the slot's byte range into the replay buffer.
This is one additional `memcpy` (slot → replay buffer) that is
unavoidable for reliability — but there is no intermediate `Vec`
between serialization and the write slot.

## Payload representation

r[zerocopy.payload]

`Payload` represents a value ready for serialization. Its variants
reflect the different ownership situations:

r[zerocopy.payload.borrowed]

**Borrowed** — a type-erased pointer to caller-owned memory (stack,
heap, arena, etc.) plus its Shape. Used on the send path when the value
is reachable for the borrow lifetime.

r[zerocopy.payload.bytes]

**Bytes** — a contiguous byte buffer that is already serialized (e.g.
when forwarding a message without deserializing, or when the link
provides raw bytes). Paired with a Backing to keep the buffer alive.

## Copy count summary

r[zerocopy.copies]

Copy counts are measured at the Roam link boundary — copies internal to
the transport library (e.g. TLS decryption, WebSocket frame assembly) are
not included.

| Direction | Stream (TCP) | WebSocket | SHM (inline) | SHM (slot-ref) | SHM (mmap) |
|-----------|-------------|-----------|--------------|-----------------|------------|
| Send      | 1           | 1         | 0            | 0               | 0          |
| Receive   | 1           | 1         | 0            | 0               | 0          |
