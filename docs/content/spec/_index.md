# Introduction

This is Rapace specification v1.0.0, last updated January 5, 2026. It canonically
lives at https://github.com/bearcove/rapace — where you can get the latest version.

Rapace is a Rust-native RPC protocol. Services are defined inside of Rust
"proto" crates, annotating traits with the `#[rapace::service]` proc macro
attribute:

```rust
#[rapace::service]
pub trait TemplateHost {
    /// Load a template by name.
    async fn load_template(&self, context_id: ContextId, name: String) -> LoadTemplateResult;

    /// Resolve a data value by path.
    async fn resolve_data(&self, context_id: ContextId, path: Vec<String>) -> ResolveDataResult;

    /// Get child keys at a data path.
    async fn keys_at(&self, context_id: ContextId, path: Vec<String>) -> KeysAtResult;

    /// Call a template function on the host.
    async fn call_function(
        &self,
        context_id: ContextId,
        name: String,
        args: Vec<Value>,
        kwargs: Vec<(String, Value)>,
    ) -> CallFunctionResult;
}
```

All types that occur as arguments or in return position must implement
[facet](https://facet.rs), so that they might be serialized and deserialized
with [facet-postcard](https://crates.io/crates/facet-postcard).

Clients/servers for other languages (Swift, TypeScript) are generated using
a Rust codegen package which is linked together with the "proto" crate to
output Swift/TypeScript packages.

Rapace defines multiple transports, including:

  * shared memory, for fast local communication (a good basis for "plugin systems")
  * arbitrary stream transport, which works well over TCP
  * websocket, for server <-> browser communication
  
This specification exists to ensure that various implementations are compatible, and
to ensure that those implementations are specified — that their code corresponds to
natural-language requirements, rather than just floating out there.

# Nomenclature

A "proto crate" contains multiple "services" (Rust async traits) which
themselves contain a bunch of "methods" (not functions), which have 
parameters and a return type.

```rust
// proto.rs

#[rapace::service]
//└────┬────┘         Service definition
pub trait TemplateHost {
//         └────┬─────┘  Service name
    async fn load_template(&self, context_id: ContextId, name: String) -> LoadTemplateResult;
    //       └─────┬──────┘       └──────────────┬────────────────┘    └────────┬──────────┘
    //          Method                       Parameters                     Return type
}

// More services can be defined in the same proto crate...
```

There are different kinds of errors in Rapace and they have different severity:

**Protocol errors** mean someone messed up the wire format and there's nothing
we can do to help. Whenever possible we'll send a human-readable payload back
explaining why we're disconnecting, but... we're going to be disconnecting.

Examples of protocol errors include:

  * Invalid handshake format
  * Invalid postcard for a method's arguments or return types
  * Sending a frame that's too big
  
**Call errors** mean a method call did not succeed, but it's not going to bring
down the entire connection.

Examples of call errors include:

  * The method call did not complete in a timely fashion
  * The peer hung up while we were waiting for a response
  * The method did complete but returned a user-defined error
  
# Message Format

This section defines the Rapace message structure: the `MsgDescHot` descriptor and payload handling.

## Overview

> r[frame.structure]
> Every message has a 64-byte `MsgDescHot` descriptor containing identity,
> flags, and payload location. Small payloads (≤16 bytes) fit inline in
> the descriptor. Larger payloads are stored separately — after the
> descriptor for stream transports, or in a shared memory slot for SHM.
> 
> ```aasvg
> +----------------------------------------------------------+
> | MsgDescHot (64 bytes)                                    |
> |                                                          |
> |    Identity: msg_id, channel_id, method_id               |
> |    Location: payload_slot, offset, len                   |
> |    Control: flags, credits, deadline                     |
> |    Inline: small payloads (<=16 bytes)                   |
> +----------------------------------------------------------+
> | Payload (if out-of-line)                                 |
> |                                                          |
> |    Stream: follows descriptor in byte stream             |
> |    SHM: in slot, zero-copy borrowable                    |
> +----------------------------------------------------------+
> ```

## MsgDescHot

r[frame.desc.size]
The descriptor MUST be exactly **64 bytes** (one cache line):

```aasvg
MsgDescHot Layout (64 bytes, cache-line aligned)

Byte:  0               8               16
       +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
    0  |         msg_id (u64)          |  channel_id   |   method_id   |  Identity
       |                               |     (u32)     |     (u32)     |  (16 bytes)
       +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   16  |  payload_slot | payload_gen   | payload_off   |  payload_len  |  Payload Location
       |     (u32)     |    (u32)      |    (u32)      |     (u32)     |  (16 bytes)
       +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   32  |     flags     | credit_grant  |          deadline_ns          |  Flow Control
       |     (u32)     |    (u32)      |             (u64)             |  (16 bytes)
       +---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
   48  |                       inline_payload                          |  Inline Payload
       |                          [u8; 16]                             |  (16 bytes)
       +---------------------------------------------------------------+
   64
```

```rust
#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct MsgDescHot {
    // Identity (16 bytes)
    pub msg_id: u64,              // Message ID (see msg_id Semantics below)
    pub channel_id: u32,          // Logical channel (0 = control)
    pub method_id: u32,           // Method to invoke (or control verb)

    // Payload location (16 bytes)
    pub payload_slot: u32,        // Slot index (0xFFFFFFFF = inline)
    pub payload_generation: u32,  // ABA safety counter (SHM only)
    pub payload_offset: u32,      // Offset within slot
    pub payload_len: u32,         // Payload byte length

    // Flow control & timing (16 bytes)
    pub flags: u32,               // MsgFlags
    pub credit_grant: u32,        // Credits granted (if CREDITS flag set)
    pub deadline_ns: u64,         // Absolute deadline (0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF = none)

    // Inline payload (16 bytes)
    pub inline_payload: [u8; 16], // Used when payload_slot == 0xFFFFFFFF
}
```

r[frame.desc.sizeof]
Implementations MUST ensure `sizeof(MsgDescHot) == 64` (4 × 16-byte blocks = one cache line).

### Field Details

#### Identity Fields

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `msg_id` | 8 bytes | Message ID, scoped per connection (see below). |
| `channel_id` | 4 bytes | Logical channel. 0 = control channel. Odd = initiator, Even = acceptor. |
| `method_id` | 4 bytes | Method identifier (FNV-1a hash) for CALL channels. Control verb for channel 0. 0 for STREAM/TUNNEL. |

#### msg_id Semantics

r[frame.msg-id.scope]
The `msg_id` field MUST be scoped per connection (not per channel). Each peer MUST maintain a monotonically increasing counter starting at 1. Every frame sent by a peer MUST use the next value from its counter.

r[frame.msg-id.call-echo]
**CALL channel rule**: For CALL channels, the response frame MUST echo the request's `msg_id`. This enables request/response correlation for logging, tracing, and debugging.

r[frame.msg-id.stream-tunnel]
**STREAM/TUNNEL channels**: Frames on these channels MUST use monotonically increasing `msg_id` values. The `msg_id` serves for ordering verification and debugging.

r[frame.msg-id.control]
**Control channel**: Control frames (channel 0) MUST use monotonic `msg_id` values like any other frame.

**Why per-connection scope**: Per-connection monotonic IDs are simpler to implement and more useful for debugging (you can sort all frames on a connection by `msg_id` to reconstruct the timeline).

#### Payload Location Fields

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `payload_slot` | 4 bytes | Slot index for SHM, or `0xFFFFFFFF` for inline payload. |
| `payload_generation` | 4 bytes | Generation counter for ABA protection (SHM only). |
| `payload_offset` | 4 bytes | Byte offset within the slot (typically 0). |
| `payload_len` | 4 bytes | Payload length in bytes. |

#### Flow Control Fields

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `flags` | 4 bytes | Bitfield of `MsgFlags`. |
| `credit_grant` | 4 bytes | Bytes of credit granted (valid if `CREDITS` flag set). |
| `deadline_ns` | 8 bytes | Absolute deadline in nanoseconds since epoch. `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` = no deadline. |

#### Inline Payload

| Field | Size | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `inline_payload` | 16 bytes | Payload data when `payload_slot == 0xFFFFFFFF` and `payload_len <= 16`. |

### Reserved Sentinel Values

r[frame.sentinel.values]
The following sentinel values MUST be used:

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `payload_slot = 0xFFFFFFFF` | Payload is inline (in `inline_payload` field) |
| `payload_slot = 0xFFFFFFFE` | Reserved for future use; implementations MUST NOT use this value |
| `deadline_ns = 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` | No deadline |

## MsgFlags

```rust
bitflags! {
    pub struct MsgFlags: u32 {
        const DATA          = 0b0000_0001;  // Message carries payload data
        const CONTROL       = 0b0000_0010;  // Control message (channel 0 only)
        const EOS           = 0b0000_0100;  // End of stream (half-close)
        const _RESERVED_08  = 0b0000_1000;  // Reserved (do not use)
        const ERROR         = 0b0001_0000;  // Response indicates error
        const HIGH_PRIORITY = 0b0010_0000;  // Priority hint (see Prioritization)
        const CREDITS       = 0b0100_0000;  // credit_grant field is valid
        const _RESERVED_80  = 0b1000_0000;  // Reserved (do not use)
        const NO_REPLY      = 0b0001_0000_0000;  // Fire-and-forget (no response expected)
        const RESPONSE      = 0b0010_0000_0000;  // This is a response frame
    }
}
```

## PayloadBuffer Abstraction

The payload is not necessarily contiguous with the descriptor. Different transports store payloads differently:

### Payload Storage Modes

| Mode | Condition | Storage | Zero-Copy |
|------|-----------|---------|-----------|
| **Inline** | `payload_len <= 16` | In `inline_payload` field | N/A |
| **Heap** | Stream/WebSocket transports | `Vec<u8>` or `bytes::Bytes` | No |
| **SHM Slot** | SHM transport | Shared memory slot | Yes |

### PayloadBuffer Interface

Logically, a `PayloadBuffer` provides:

```rust
trait PayloadBuffer {
    /// Borrow the payload bytes.
    fn as_ref(&self) -> &[u8];
    
    /// For SHM: the slot is freed when the guard is dropped.
    /// For heap: the buffer is deallocated.
}
```

### SHM Zero-Copy Semantics

For shared memory transports, the payload is stored in a slot within the shared memory segment:

1. **Sender** allocates a slot, writes payload, enqueues descriptor
2. **Receiver** dequeues descriptor, borrows payload via `SlotGuard`
3. **Receiver** processes payload while holding the guard
4. **Receiver** drops the guard → slot is freed back to the sender's pool

r[frame.shm.slot-guard]
The `SlotGuard` MUST ensure:
- Payload bytes remain valid for the lifetime of the guard
- The slot cannot be reused until the guard is dropped
- The generation counter prevents ABA problems

r[frame.shm.borrow-required]
Receivers MUST be able to borrow payload data without copying. Copying is permitted only if the application explicitly requests ownership.

## Payload Placement Rules

### When to Use Inline

r[frame.payload.inline]
For inline payloads (payload length ≤ 16 bytes): implementations MUST set `payload_slot = 0xFFFFFFFF`, copy payload to `inline_payload[0..payload_len]`, and `payload_offset` and `payload_generation` are ignored.

### When to Use Out-of-Line

r[frame.payload.out-of-line]
For out-of-line payloads (payload length > 16 bytes): for SHM, implementations MUST allocate a slot and set `payload_slot` to the slot index. For stream/WebSocket transports, the payload MUST follow the descriptor in the byte stream. Implementations MUST set `payload_len` to the actual length.

### Empty Payloads

r[frame.payload.empty]
Empty payloads (`payload_len = 0`) MUST be valid. Implementations MUST set `payload_slot = 0xFFFFFFFF` (inline mode); `inline_payload` contents are ignored. Empty payloads are used for EOS frames, metadata-only frames, etc.

## Descriptor Encoding on Wire

r[frame.desc.encoding]
The 64-byte `MsgDescHot` MUST be encoded as raw bytes (NOT Postcard-encoded):
- All fields MUST be little-endian
- There MUST be no padding between fields
- The total size MUST be exactly 64 bytes

This allows direct memory mapping on SHM, single memcpy for stream transports, and predictable offset calculations.


# Transports

Rapace supports multiple transports with different characteristics:

| Transport | Use Case | Max Payload | Zero-Copy | Browser |
|-----------|----------|-------------|-----------|---------|
| Stream (TCP, Unix) | General networking | Negotiated (1-16 MB) | No | No |
| WebSocket | Browser, firewalls | Negotiated (16 MB) | No | Yes |
| SHM Hub | Same-host 1:N IPC | 16 MB | Yes | No |

Each transport defines:
- How frames are delimited
- Where payloads are stored
- Maximum payload size
- Signaling mechanism

## WebSocket

### Frame Encoding

r[transport.websocket.frame]
Each WebSocket **binary message** contains exactly one Rapace frame:

```aasvg
+--------------------------------------------+
| MsgDescHot (64 bytes, raw little-endian)   |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Payload (N bytes, postcard-encoded)        |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

### Reading Frames

1. Receive binary WebSocket message
2. **Validate**: If message length < 64, reject as malformed
3. **Validate**: If message length > `max_payload_size + 64`, reject
4. Parse first 64 bytes as `MsgDescHot`
5. Remaining bytes are the payload

### Writing Frames

1. Encode payload (postcard)
2. Allocate buffer of `64 + payload.len()` bytes
3. Write 64-byte `MsgDescHot` (little-endian)
4. Write payload bytes
5. Send as single binary WebSocket message

### Ping/Pong

WebSocket has its own ping/pong mechanism. Rapace-level Ping/Pong (control verbs 5/6) is separate and used for application-level liveness checking.

Negotiate `RAPACE_PING` capability to determine which to use.


## Stream Transport

### Frame Encoding

```aasvg
+--------------------------------------------+
| Length (varint, 1-10 bytes)                |
+--------------------------------------------+
| MsgDescHot (64 bytes, raw little-endian)   |
+--------------------------------------------+
| Payload (N bytes, postcard-encoded)        |
+--------------------------------------------+
```

The length prefix is a varint encoding of `64 + payload_len`.

### Why Length Prefix?

Stream transports use a length prefix (even though `payload_len` is in the descriptor) for:

1. **Early rejection**: Validate `max_frame_size` before reading/allocating the body
2. **Attack resistance**: Reject oversized frames without buffering any payload
3. **Simple framing**: One "read exactly N bytes" loop instead of two-phase parsing
4. **Opaque forwarding**: Relays/recorders can copy frames without parsing the descriptor

WebSocket and SHM transports don't need this because they have built-in message boundaries.

### Reading Frames

1. Read varint length prefix
   - Max 10 bytes; if continuation bit still set after 10 bytes, reject as malformed
   - If the stream ends before the varint terminates, reject as malformed
2. **Validate**: If length < 64, reject as malformed (frame too small for descriptor)
3. **Validate**: If length > `max_payload_size + 64`, reject immediately (do not allocate)

> **Note**: `max_frame_size = max_payload_size + 64` (descriptor size). The handshake negotiates `max_payload_size`; frame size is derived.
4. Allocate buffer of `length` bytes
5. Read exactly `length` bytes into buffer
6. Parse first 64 bytes as `MsgDescHot`
7. **Validate**: If `payload_len` in descriptor != `length - 64`, reject as protocol error (prevents desync)
8. Remaining bytes are the payload

### Writing Frames

1. Encode payload:
   - For CALL and STREAM channels: Postcard-encode the payload
   - For TUNNEL channels: Use raw bytes (no encoding)
2. Write varint of `64 + payload.len()`
3. Write 64-byte `MsgDescHot` (little-endian)
4. Write payload bytes

### Validation Rules

r[transport.stream.validation]
Receivers MUST enforce the following validation rules:

r[transport.stream.varint-limit]
If the varint length prefix exceeds 10 bytes (continuation bit still set after 10 bytes), the receiver MUST reject as malformed and close the connection.

r[transport.stream.varint-terminated]
If the stream ends before a terminating varint byte is read, the receiver MUST reject as malformed and close the connection.

r[transport.stream.min-length]
If the length is less than 64 bytes, the receiver MUST reject as malformed and close the connection.

r[transport.stream.max-length]
If the length exceeds `max_payload_size + 64`, the receiver MUST reject before allocating memory and close the connection.

r[transport.stream.length-match]
If `payload_len` in the descriptor does not equal `length - 64`, the receiver MUST reject as a protocol error and close the connection.

These rules prevent varint overflow attacks, frames too small to contain a valid descriptor, memory exhaustion from oversized frames, and desync from mismatched length prefix vs descriptor.

### Size Limits

r[transport.stream.size-limits]
The `max_payload_size` is negotiated during handshake (frame size = payload + 64). Frames exceeding `max_payload_size + 64` MUST be rejected before allocation. If a payload is too large, implementations SHOULD use a STREAM channel and chunk the data.

## WebTransport

[WebTransport](https://www.w3.org/TR/webtransport/) provides QUIC-based communication from browsers with support for multiple streams, datagrams, and connection migration.

### Why WebTransport?

| Feature | WebSocket | WebTransport |
|---------|-----------|--------------|
| Protocol | TCP | QUIC (UDP) |
| Head-of-line blocking | Yes (single stream) | No (multiple streams) |
| Connection migration | No | Yes |
| 0-RTT reconnection | No | Yes |
| Datagrams | No | Yes |
| Native multiplexing | No | Yes |

WebTransport is the recommended browser transport for new deployments.

### Connection Establishment

```javascript
// Client (browser)
const transport = new WebTransport('https://example.com/rapace');
await transport.ready;

// Use bidirectional stream for Rapace
const stream = await transport.createBidirectionalStream();
const writer = stream.writable.getWriter();
const reader = stream.readable.getReader();
```

r[transport.webtransport.server-requirements]
Server endpoints MUST serve over HTTPS (WebTransport requires TLS), handle the WebTransport handshake at the specified path, and support bidirectional streams.

### Stream Mapping

Two modes are supported:

#### Single Stream Mode (Simple)

All Rapace frames on one bidirectional stream:

```
WebTransport Connection
└── Bidirectional Stream 0: All Rapace frames
```

Frame encoding is identical to WebSocket (no length prefix):

```
┌────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ MsgDescHot (64 bytes, raw little-endian)   │
├────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ Payload (N bytes, postcard-encoded)        │
└────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

#### Multi-Stream Mode (Advanced)

Map Rapace channels to WebTransport streams:

```
WebTransport Connection
├── Bidirectional Stream 0: Rapace control channel (ch 0)
├── Bidirectional Stream 1: Rapace channel 1
├── Bidirectional Stream 2: Rapace channel 2
└── ...
```

Benefits:
- No head-of-line blocking between channels
- Native priority support (QUIC stream priorities)
- Independent flow control per channel

Negotiate multi-stream mode via handshake capability bit 4 (`WEBTRANSPORT_MULTI_STREAM`). See [Handshake: Defined Feature Bits](@/spec/handshake.md#defined-feature-bits).

### Datagram Support

WebTransport datagrams can be used for unreliable messages:

```javascript
// Send unreliable datagram
const writer = transport.datagrams.writable.getWriter();
await writer.write(frameBytes);

// Receive datagrams
const reader = transport.datagrams.readable.getReader();
const { value } = await reader.read();
```

Use cases:
- Real-time telemetry (acceptable to lose some samples)
- Ping/pong with tolerance for loss
- Streaming media (video/audio frames)

r[transport.webtransport.datagram-restrictions]
Datagrams use the same frame format but with restrictions:
- Datagrams MUST be used only for STREAM channels marked as unreliable via `rapace.unreliable` metadata (CALL and TUNNEL channels require reliability and ordering)
- Datagrams are size-limited by QUIC datagram MTU (~1200 bytes)
- Use of datagrams requires handshake capability bit 5 (`WEBTRANSPORT_DATAGRAMS`) to be negotiated

To mark a STREAM channel as unreliable:
```rust
OpenChannel {
    kind: ChannelKind::Stream,
    metadata: vec![
        ("rapace.unreliable".into(), vec![1]),  // Enable unreliable delivery
    ],
    // ...
}
```

When unreliable delivery is enabled, the transport MAY use WebTransport datagrams instead of streams for that channel. Items may be lost or arrive out of order.

### Server Implementation

```rust
// Rust server using h3-webtransport
async fn handle_webtransport(session: WebTransportSession) {
    // Accept the incoming Rapace connection
    let stream = session.accept_bi().await?;
    
    // Wrap in Rapace transport
    let transport = WebTransportRapace::new(stream);
    
    // Handle Rapace protocol
    handle_rapace_connection(transport).await
}
```

### Browser Client Implementation

```typescript
class WebTransportRapaceClient {
    private transport: WebTransport;
    private writer: WritableStreamDefaultWriter<Uint8Array>;
    private reader: ReadableStreamDefaultReader<Uint8Array>;
    
    static async connect(url: string): Promise<WebTransportRapaceClient> {
        const transport = new WebTransport(url);
        await transport.ready;
        
        const stream = await transport.createBidirectionalStream();
        return new WebTransportRapaceClient(
            transport,
            stream.writable.getWriter(),
            stream.readable.getReader()
        );
    }
    
    async sendFrame(frame: Uint8Array): Promise<void> {
        await this.writer.write(frame);
    }
    
    async recvFrame(): Promise<Uint8Array> {
        const { value, done } = await this.reader.read();
        if (done) throw new Error('Connection closed');
        return value;
    }
    
    close(): void {
        this.transport.close();
    }
}
```

### Fallback to WebSocket

For browsers that don't support WebTransport:

```typescript
async function connect(url: string): Promise<RapaceTransport> {
    if ('WebTransport' in window) {
        try {
            return await WebTransportRapaceClient.connect(url.replace('wss:', 'https:'));
        } catch (e) {
            console.warn('WebTransport failed, falling back to WebSocket', e);
        }
    }
    return await WebSocketRapaceClient.connect(url);
}
```

### Size Limits

- Stream messages: Negotiated `max_payload_size` (typically 16 MB)
- Datagrams: ~1200 bytes (QUIC MTU minus overhead)

## Shared Memory Transport (Pair)

The "pair" SHM transport is for 1:1 communication between two processes.

### Memory Layout

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│  Segment Header (128 bytes)                                         │

### Sending a Frame

1. **Payload ≤ 16 bytes (inline)**:
   - Set `payload_slot = 0xFFFFFFFF`
   - Copy to `inline_payload`
   - Enqueue descriptor to ring

2. **Payload > 16 bytes**:
   - Allocate slot from Treiber stack (lock-free)
   - Copy payload to slot
   - Mark slot as `InFlight`
   - Set `payload_slot`, `payload_generation`, `payload_len`
   - Enqueue descriptor to ring
   - Signal peer via futex

### Receiving a Frame

1. Dequeue descriptor from ring
2. Signal peer that ring space is available (futex)
3. If `payload_slot == 0xFFFFFFFF`:
   - Payload is in `inline_payload[0..payload_len]`
4. Else:
   - Create `SlotGuard` referencing the slot
   - Borrow payload via guard (zero-copy)
   - Process payload
   - Drop guard → slot freed back to sender's pool

### Slot Lifecycle

```
Free → Allocated → InFlight → Free
       (sender)   (sender)   (receiver frees)
```

Generation counter increments on each allocation, preventing ABA problems.

### Size Limits

- Default `slot_size`: 4096 bytes (configurable)
- Payloads > `slot_size` fail with `PayloadTooLarge`
- For large data, use STREAM channels and chunk

## Shared Memory Transport (Hub)

The "hub" SHM transport is for 1:N communication (one host, multiple peers).

### Size Classes

The hub uses tiered size classes to support payloads up to 16 MB:

| Class | Slot Size | Initial Slots | Total Pool |
|-------|-----------|---------------|------------|
| 0 | 1 KB | 1024 | 1 MB |
| 1 | 16 KB | 256 | 4 MB |
| 2 | 256 KB | 32 | 8 MB |
| 3 | 4 MB | 8 | 32 MB |
| 4 | 16 MB | 4 | 64 MB |

### Allocation

1. Find smallest size class that fits the payload
2. Try to allocate from that class
3. If exhausted, try larger classes
4. If all exhausted, wait for slot availability (futex)

### Slot Reference Encoding

Hub slot references encode both class and index in `payload_slot`:

```
Bits 31-29: Size class (0-7)
Bits 28-0:  Global index within class
```

### Memory Layout

```

## Signaling Mechanisms

### Futex (SHM, Linux)

SHM transports use futex for cross-process signaling:

| Futex | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `a_to_b_data_futex` | A signals B that data is available |
| `a_to_b_space_futex` | B signals A that ring space is available |
| `b_to_a_data_futex` | B signals A that data is available |
| `b_to_a_space_futex` | A signals B that ring space is available |
| `slot_available_futex` | Signal that a slot was freed |

Signal pattern:
```rust
futex.fetch_add(1, Ordering::Release);
futex_wake(&futex, u32::MAX);
```

Wait pattern:
```rust
let current = futex.load(Ordering::Acquire);
futex_wait(&futex, current, timeout);
```

### Doorbell (SHM, macOS/cross-platform)

On platforms without futex, Unix socketpairs provide signaling:

- Send 1-byte datagram to signal
- `poll`/`epoll`/`kqueue` for async waiting

## Handshake Considerations

### Limit Exchange

During handshake, peers exchange:
- `max_payload_size`: Maximum payload bytes per frame
- `max_channels`: Maximum concurrent channels

Effective limits are the minimum of both peers.

### Transport Detection

The transport type is typically known from context:
- TCP connection → stream transport
- WebSocket upgrade → WebSocket transport
- SHM file descriptor → SHM transport

The handshake protocol is the same; only framing differs.

## Summary

| Aspect | Stream | WebSocket | WebTransport | SHM Pair | SHM Hub |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------------|----------|---------|
| Length prefix | Varint | None | None | None | None |
| Payload location | After desc | After desc | After desc | Slot/inline | Slot/inline |
| Max payload | Negotiated | Negotiated | Negotiated | `slot_size` | 16 MB |
| Zero-copy receive | No | No | No | Yes | Yes |
| Signaling | TCP | WS events | QUIC | Futex | Futex |
| Browser support | No | Yes | Yes (modern) | No | No |
| Multiplexing | Rapace | Rapace | Native+Rapace | Rapace | Rapace |


# Handshake & Capabilities

r[handshake.required]
When a transport connection is established, both peers MUST exchange a `Hello`
message before any other communication. The handshake:

1. **Validates compatibility**: Protocol version, required features
2. **Negotiates capabilities**: What optional features both peers support
3. **Exchanges limits**: Maximum payload sizes, channel counts
4. **Registers methods**: Method IDs and signature hashes for compatibility checking

```aasvg
Initiator                                      Acceptor
    │                                              │
    │  [transport connection established]          │
    │                                              │

    │                                              │
    │  [connection ready for RPC]                  │
    │                                              │
```

## Hello Message

The `Hello` message is sent on channel 0 as a control message with `method_id = 0` (reserved for handshake).

```rust
Hello {
    protocol_version: u32,      // Protocol version (see below)
    role: Role,                 // INITIATOR or ACCEPTOR
    required_features: u64,     // Features the peer MUST support
    supported_features: u64,    // Features the peer supports
    limits: Limits,             // Advertised limits
    methods: Vec<MethodInfo>,   // Method registry
    params: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,  // Extension parameters
}

enum Role {
    Initiator = 1,
    Acceptor = 2,
}

struct Limits {
    max_payload_size: u32,      // Maximum payload bytes per frame
    max_channels: u32,          // Maximum concurrent channels (0 = unlimited)
    max_pending_calls: u32,     // Maximum pending RPC calls (0 = unlimited)
}

struct MethodInfo {
    method_id: u32,             // Method identifier (see Core Protocol)
    sig_hash: [u8; 32],         // Structural signature hash (BLAKE3)
    name: Option<String>,       // Human-readable "Service.method" (for debugging)
}
```

### Frame Structure

```
channel_id = 0
method_id = 0 (HELLO verb)
flags = CONTROL
payload = postcard-encoded Hello
```

## Protocol Version

The `protocol_version` field uses semantic versioning packed into a u32:

```
protocol_version = (major << 16) | minor
```

For this specification: `protocol_version = 0x00010000` (v1.0)

### Compatibility Rules

r[handshake.version.major]
If the major version does not match, the connection MUST be rejected.

r[handshake.version.minor]
If only the minor version differs, the connection proceeds; peers MUST use the lower minor version's feature set.

## Role Validation

Both peers declare their role explicitly:

- **Initiator**: The peer that opened the transport connection (client)
- **Acceptor**: The peer that accepted the transport connection (server)

Roles determine channel ID allocation:
- Initiator uses odd channel IDs (1, 3, 5, ...)
- Acceptor uses even channel IDs (2, 4, 6, ...)

r[handshake.role.validation]
If both peers claim the same role, or roles don't match the transport semantics (e.g., the accepting side claims INITIATOR), the connection MUST be rejected with a protocol error.

## Feature Negotiation

Features are represented as bits in a 64-bit field. There are two categories:

### Required Features (`required_features`)

r[handshake.features.required]
Features the sender requires the peer to support. If `(required_features & peer.supported_features) != required_features`, the connection MUST be rejected.

### Supported Features (`supported_features`)

Features the sender supports but doesn't require. The effective feature set for the connection is:

```
effective_features = my.supported_features & peer.supported_features
```

### Defined Feature Bits

| Bit | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 0 | `ATTACHED_STREAMS` | Supports STREAM/TUNNEL channels attached to calls |
| 1 | `CALL_ENVELOPE` | Uses CallResult envelope with status + trailers |
| 2 | `CREDIT_FLOW_CONTROL` | Enforces credit-based flow control |
| 3 | `RAPACE_PING` | Supports Rapace-level Ping/Pong |
| 6-63 | Reserved | Reserved for future use |

For protocol v1.0, bits 0-1 (`ATTACHED_STREAMS`, `CALL_ENVELOPE`) SHOULD be set as required by conforming implementations.

### Feature Negotiation Example

```
Initiator:
  required_features  = 0b0011  (ATTACHED_STREAMS, CALL_ENVELOPE)
  supported_features = 0b1111  (all four features)

Acceptor:
  required_features  = 0b0001  (ATTACHED_STREAMS only)
  supported_features = 0b0111  (not RAPACE_PING)

Negotiation:
  Initiator requires CALL_ENVELOPE, Acceptor supports it → OK
  Acceptor requires ATTACHED_STREAMS, Initiator supports it → OK
  effective_features = 0b0111 & 0b1111 = 0b0111
  (RAPACE_PING not in effective set)
```

## Limits Negotiation

Both peers advertise their limits. The effective limit is the **minimum** of both:

```
effective_max_payload = min(my.limits.max_payload_size, peer.limits.max_payload_size)
effective_max_channels = min(my.limits.max_channels, peer.limits.max_channels)
```

A value of 0 means "unlimited" (implementation-defined maximum).

### Transport-Specific Limits

Different transports have different inherent limits:

| Transport | Typical max_payload_size |
|-----------|-------------------------|
| Stream (TCP) | Limited by memory, often 1-16 MB |
| WebSocket | Limited by implementation, often 16 MB |
| SHM (Pair) | `slot_size` (default 4KB) |
| SHM (Hub) | 16 MB (largest size class) |

Peers SHOULD advertise realistic limits based on their transport.

## Method Registry

The `methods` array contains information about every method the peer can handle (for acceptors) or intends to call (for initiators).

### MethodInfo Fields

- **method_id**: Method identifier per [Core Protocol: Method ID Computation](@/spec/core.md#method-id-computation). The method_id already encodes "Service.method", so a separate service_id is not needed.
- **sig_hash**: 32-byte BLAKE3 hash of the method signature (arguments + return type)
- **name**: Optional human-readable name for debugging (e.g., `"Calculator.add"`)

### Registry Validation

r[handshake.registry.validation]
The method registry MUST be validated during handshake.

r[handshake.registry.no-zero]
If any entry has `method_id = 0`, handshake MUST fail.

r[handshake.registry.no-duplicates]
If any two entries have the same `method_id`, handshake MUST fail.

r[handshake.registry.cross-service]
Different services with methods that hash to the same `method_id` are collisions and MUST be rejected.

These rules apply even if methods come from different services. Runtime dispatch is by `method_id` only; there is no separate service routing layer.

r[handshake.registry.failure]
If validation fails, implementations MUST send `CloseChannel { channel_id: 0, reason: Error("duplicate method_id") }` and close the transport.

### Signature Hash

The `sig_hash` is a BLAKE3 hash of the method's structural signature, computed from the [facet](https://facet.rs) `Shape` of argument and return types. See [Schema Evolution](@/spec/schema-evolution.md) for the complete algorithm.

Hash inputs include:
- Field **identifiers** (names) and order
- Field types (recursively)
- Enum variant names, discriminants, and payloads
- Container types (Vec, Option, HashMap, etc.)

Hash excludes:
- Type names (struct/enum names can be renamed freely)
- Module paths
- Documentation

Two methods with the same `sig_hash` are wire-compatible.

r[handshake.sig-hash.blake3]
BLAKE3 MUST be used as the hash algorithm for signature hashes. This is not negotiable.

### Compatibility Checking

After exchanging registries, each peer can determine:

1. **Compatible methods**: Same `method_id` and same `sig_hash`
2. **Incompatible methods**: Same `method_id` but different `sig_hash`
3. **Unknown methods**: `method_id` present on one side but not the other

For **incompatible methods**, implementations SHOULD:
- Reject calls to that method immediately (before encoding)
- Optionally provide detailed schema diff for debugging

For **unknown methods**, the peer that doesn't have the method will return `UNIMPLEMENTED` at call time.

## Extension Parameters

The `params` field is a key-value map for future extensions:

```rust
params: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>
```

Known parameter keys (see [Metadata Conventions: Connection Parameters](@/spec/metadata.md#connection-parameters) for encoding details):
- `rapace.ping_interval_ms`: Suggested ping interval in milliseconds
- `rapace.compression`: Supported compression algorithms
- `rapace.default_priority`: Default priority for calls on this connection

**Default priority**: If `rapace.default_priority` is present, all calls on this connection use that priority level unless overridden by per-call `rapace.priority` metadata or the `HIGH_PRIORITY` frame flag. If absent, the default is 128 (middle of Normal range).

r[handshake.params.unknown]
Unknown parameters MUST be ignored.

## Handshake Timing

### Ordering

r[handshake.ordering]
After transport connection is established, each peer MUST send `Hello` immediately. Peers MUST wait until they have both sent and received `Hello` before sending any other frames. After successful handshake, the connection is ready for RPC.

### Timeout

r[handshake.timeout]
Implementations MUST impose a handshake timeout of at most 30 seconds. Implementations MAY use shorter timeouts (e.g., 2 seconds for localhost connections). If `Hello` is not received within the timeout, the connection MUST be closed.

### Failure

r[handshake.failure]
If handshake fails (version mismatch, required feature not supported, role conflict, non-Hello first frame), the peer that detects the failure:
- MAY send a `CloseChannel` on channel 0 with an error reason string
- MUST close the transport connection immediately after
- MUST discard any further frames without processing

r[handshake.first-frame]
If the first frame received on a new connection is not a `Hello` (i.e., `channel_id != 0` or `method_id != 0`), this is a handshake failure. The receiver:
- SHOULD send `CloseChannel { channel_id: 0, reason: Error("expected Hello") }` if possible
- MUST close the transport connection
- MUST discard the non-Hello frame without processing

r[handshake.explicit-required]
All implementations MUST perform an explicit `Hello` exchange. There is no implicit handshake mode.

## Transport-Specific Considerations

### Shared Memory Transport

For SHM transports, the handshake serves additional purposes:

- Validates segment magic and protocol version (done before Hello)
- Exchanges peer IDs for channel ID allocation
- Negotiates slot sizes and counts (via limits or transport-specific params)

The segment header (`SegmentHeader` or `HubHeader`) contains version information that is validated when mapping the segment. The `Hello` exchange happens after segment mapping succeeds.

### WebSocket Transport

For WebSocket, the HTTP upgrade handshake happens first (at the transport layer). The Rapace `Hello` exchange happens immediately after the WebSocket connection is established.

Rapace-level ping/pong is separate from WebSocket ping/pong frames. Use `RAPACE_PING` feature negotiation to determine which to use.

### Stream Transport (TCP, Unix Socket)

No transport-level handshake. The first bytes on the connection are the length-prefixed Rapace `Hello` frame.

## Security Considerations

The handshake does not provide authentication or encryption. Those concerns are delegated to:

- Transport-level security (TLS, Unix socket permissions)
- Application-level authentication (tokens in `Hello.params` or `OpenChannel.metadata`)

Implementations SHOULD use secure transports in production.

## Summary

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Handshake required** | Yes, explicit `Hello` exchange before any other frames |
| **Protocol version** | Major version must match; minor version uses lower |
| **Role** | Explicit; determines channel ID allocation |
| **Features** | Bitfield; required must be supported; effective = intersection |
| **Limits** | Effective = minimum of both peers |
| **Method registry** | Full exchange; sig_hash for compatibility |
| **Timeout** | Implementation-defined, recommended 30s |

# Data Model

This section defines the core Rapace data model: what types can be used in service definitions.

## Type System

Rapace encodes all values using the Postcard wire format. The protocol is non-self-describing:
peers must agree on schema via [Facet](https://facets.rs)-derived structural hashing before
exchanging messages.

r[data.type-system.postcard] All Rapace payloads MUST be encoded using the
Postcard wire format. See [Postcard: Wire
format](https://postcard.jamesmunns.com/wire-format).

### Explicitly Unsupported

For compatibility purposes, some types that could technically be encoded as
Postcard must be explicitly rejected by implementations:

r[data.unsupported.usize]
Implementations MUST reject `usize` or `isize` in method signatures; use explicit integer
sizes (`u32`, `u64`, etc.) for cross-platform compatibility.

r[data.unsupported.pointers]
Implementations MUST reject raw pointer types (e.g. `*const T`, `*mut T`) in arguments or return values.

r[data.unsupported.self-ref]
Implementations MUST reject self-referential types in arguments or return values.

r[data.unsupported.unions]
Implementations MUST reject untagged unions in arguments or return values.

r[data.unsupported.borrowed-return]
Implementations MUST reject borrowed return types (e.g. `&[u8]`, `&str`) in method signatures.

> **Cross-language note**: Borrowed arguments (like `&str`) are a Rust API convenience. On the wire, all data is transmitted as owned bytes. Non-Rust implementations always work with owned data.

## Type Definition in Rust

Types are defined in Rust using the `Facet` derive macro from the [facet](https://facet.rs) ecosystem:

```rust
use facet::Facet;

#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct Point {
    pub x: i32,
    pub y: i32,
}

#[derive(Facet)]
pub enum Shape {
    Circle { radius: f64 },
    Rectangle { width: f64, height: f64 },
    Point(Point),
}

#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct Message {
    pub id: [u8; 16],
    pub timestamp: u64,
    pub payload: Vec<u8>,
    pub metadata: Option<HashMap<String, String>>,
}
```

The `Facet` derive macro provides:
- **Type introspection** at compile time (field names, types, layout)
- **Schema hashing** for compatibility checking (see [Schema Evolution](@/spec/schema-evolution.md))
- **Code generation** for other languages

## Service Definitions

Services are defined using the `#[rapace::service]` attribute macro:

```rust
use rapace::prelude::*;

#[rapace::service]
pub trait Graphics {
    async fn draw(&self, shape: Shape) -> Result<(), String>;
    async fn clear(&self);
    async fn save(&self, path: String) -> Result<Vec<u8>, String>;
}
```

The macro generates:
- `GraphicsClient` for making calls
- `GraphicsServer<T>` for handling calls
- Method IDs for dispatch
- Schema hashes for compatibility checking

r[data.service.facet-required]
All argument and return types MUST implement `Facet`.

## Design Principles

### Non-Self-Describing

r[data.wire.non-self-describing]
The wire format MUST encode only values, omitting type information (field names, struct names, and type tags). This makes the encoding:

- ✅ **Compact**: No metadata overhead
- ✅ **Fast**: Direct serialization, no schema lookups
- ❌ **Requires shared schema**: Both peers must have identical type definitions

Schema mismatches are caught at **handshake time** via structural hashing (see [Handshake & Capabilities](@/spec/handshake.md)).

### Field-Order Dependent

r[data.wire.field-order]
Struct fields MUST be encoded in declaration order with no names or indices. This means:

- ✅ **Minimal encoding overhead**: Just values, no field tags
- ❌ **Field order is immutable**: Reordering fields breaks compatibility
- ❌ **Adding/removing fields breaks compatibility**: See [Schema Evolution](@/spec/schema-evolution.md)

```rust
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct V1 {
    pub a: i32,
    pub b: i32,
}

// ❌ BREAKING CHANGE: field order changed
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct V2 {
    pub b: i32,  // now first!
    pub a: i32,
}

// ❌ BREAKING CHANGE: field added
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct V3 {
    pub a: i32,
    pub b: i32,
    pub c: i32,  // new field
}
```

For versioning strategies, see [Schema Evolution](@/spec/schema-evolution.md).

### Structural Typing

Two types with **identical structure** are considered compatible, even if they have different names:

```rust
// Package A
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct Point { pub x: i32, pub y: i32 }

// Package B
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct Coordinate { pub x: i32, pub y: i32 }

// These are structurally identical and have the same schema hash
```

This enables:
- ✅ **Refactoring freedom**: Rename types without breaking compatibility
- ✅ **Cross-organization interop**: No central type registry required
- ⚠️ **Type safety is structural**: Compiler can't distinguish semantically different types with same structure

### Determinism

#### Map Ordering

r[data.determinism.map-order]
Map encoding (`HashMap<K, V>`, `BTreeMap<K, V>`) is non-canonical. Implementations MUST treat maps as equal based on key-value content, not byte representation. The wire representation depends on iteration order, which may vary between different instances, implementations, and program runs.

If you need canonical ordering, sort keys at the application level before encoding.

#### Float Encoding

r[data.float.encoding]
Floating-point types (`f32`, `f64`) MUST be encoded as IEEE 754 little-endian bit patterns.

r[data.float.nan]
Encoders MAY canonicalize NaN values, but receivers MUST accept any IEEE 754 NaN bit pattern.

r[data.float.negative-zero]
Negative zero (`-0.0`) and positive zero (`+0.0`) MUST be encoded as their distinct bit patterns.

### Schema Hashing

The `Facet`-derived schema hash is computed from:

- ✅ **Field names**: Changing a field name changes the hash
- ✅ **Field order**: Reordering fields changes the hash
- ✅ **Field types**: Changing types changes the hash (recursively)
- ✅ **Enum variant names and discriminants**
- ❌ **Type names**: Struct/enum names do NOT affect the hash
- ❌ **Module paths**: Paths do NOT affect the hash
- ❌ **Documentation**: Comments do NOT affect the hash

This means two types with the same structure but different names are schema-compatible, while two types with the same name but different field names are NOT compatible.

## Result<T, E> and Protocol Status

Rust's `Result<T, E>` type is supported as a normal enum-like type. It does NOT replace the protocol-level status in the `CallResult` envelope.

```rust
#[rapace::service]
pub trait Files {
    // Returns Result<Vec<u8>, FileError>
    // Protocol status is ALWAYS OK if the method returns successfully
    // FileError is just a regular enum variant, not a protocol error
    async fn read(&self, path: String) -> Result<Vec<u8>, FileError>;
}
```

**Protocol errors** (connection failures, serialization errors, deadline exceeded) are signaled via the `CallResult.status` field with a non-zero error code.

**Application errors** (like `FileError::NotFound`) are encoded as normal return values with protocol status `OK`.

If you want other languages to recognize application-level errors without understanding your specific error type, consider using a standard error enum or including error metadata in the response type.

# Schema Evolution

This section defines how Rapace handles schema changes, compatibility checking, and API versioning.

## Core Principle

**Schema changes are breaking by default.** Field-order encoding means:

- ❌ Adding fields breaks compatibility
- ❌ Removing fields breaks compatibility
- ❌ Reordering fields breaks compatibility
- ❌ Changing field types breaks compatibility
- ❌ Renaming fields breaks compatibility

This is not a bug—it's a deliberate design choice for:

- ✅ Minimal wire overhead (no field tags, no names on the wire)
- ✅ Fast encoding/decoding (direct serialization)
- ✅ Deterministic hashing (structural compatibility via digests)
- ✅ Semantic safety (catch mismatches at handshake, not at runtime)

## Compatibility Detection

Rapace detects incompatibilities at **handshake time** via **structural schema hashing**.

### What's In the Hash

The schema hash (also called `sig_hash`) is computed from the structural shape of a type. It includes:

| Included | Example |
|----------|---------|
| Field identifiers | `"user_id"`, `"name"` |
| Field order | `(user_id, name)` ≠ `(name, user_id)` |
| Field types (recursively) | `i32`, `String`, nested structs |
| Enum variant identifiers | `"Red"`, `"Green"`, `"Blue"` |
| Enum variant order | `(Red, Green, Blue)` ≠ `(Green, Red, Blue)` |
| Enum variant payloads | `Circle(f64)` ≠ `Circle(f32)` |
| Container shapes | `Vec<T>`, `Option<T>`, `HashMap<K,V>` |
| Integer sizes and signedness | `i32` ≠ `u32` ≠ `i64` |

### What's NOT In the Hash

| Excluded | Why |
|----------|-----|
| Type names (struct/enum names) | Allows renaming types without breaking |
| Module paths | Allows moving types between modules |
| Documentation comments | Not semantically relevant |
| Visibility (`pub`, `pub(crate)`) | Runtime irrelevant |
| Generic parameter names | Only instantiated shapes matter |

### Field and Variant Identifiers

**Critical**: Field and variant identifiers ARE included in the hash. This means renaming a field or variant is a breaking change.

The identifier is the **canonical wire name** for the field/variant:

- In Rust with Facet: the field name as declared (e.g., `user_id`)
- Facet rename attributes (if any) override the default

r[schema.identifier.normalization]
Identifiers MUST be exact UTF-8 byte strings. Identifiers are case-sensitive (`userId` ≠ `user_id` ≠ `UserId`). No Unicode normalization (NFC/NFKD) MUST be applied. Hashing MUST use the raw UTF-8 bytes.

**Tuple fields**: For tuple structs and tuple variants, implicit identifiers are used: `_0`, `_1`, `_2`, etc.

### Why Include Identifiers?

Including field/variant identifiers provides semantic safety:

```rust
// These have identical wire encoding but DIFFERENT hashes:
struct UserRef { user_id: i64 }
struct OrderRef { order_id: i64 }  // Different field name!

// This prevents accidentally treating a UserRef as an OrderRef
```

Without identifiers in the hash, these would be "compatible" and you'd only discover the bug at runtime when semantics break.

### Type Name Freedom

Type names are NOT in the hash, so you can rename types freely:

```rust
// Before
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }

// After (OK - same hash)
struct Coordinate { x: i32, y: i32 }
```

This enables:
- Refactoring type names without coordination
- Different codebases using different names for the same structure
- Cross-language bindings using idiomatic names

## Hash Algorithm

r[schema.hash.algorithm]
The schema hash MUST use BLAKE3 over a canonical serialization of the type shape.

### Canonical Shape Serialization

The shape is serialized deterministically as:

```
shape_bytes = serialize_shape(facet_shape)
sig_hash = blake3(shape_bytes)
```

Where `serialize_shape` produces a canonical byte representation using the following rules.

### Shape Tags

| Tag | Value (u8) | Type |
|-----|------------|------|
| `UNIT` | 0x00 | Unit type `()` |
| `BOOL` | 0x01 | Boolean |
| `U8` | 0x02 | Unsigned 8-bit |
| `U16` | 0x03 | Unsigned 16-bit |
| `U32` | 0x04 | Unsigned 32-bit |
| `U64` | 0x05 | Unsigned 64-bit |
| `U128` | 0x06 | Unsigned 128-bit |
| `I8` | 0x07 | Signed 8-bit |
| `I16` | 0x08 | Signed 16-bit |
| `I32` | 0x09 | Signed 32-bit |
| `I64` | 0x0A | Signed 64-bit |
| `I128` | 0x0B | Signed 128-bit |
| `F32` | 0x0C | 32-bit float |
| `F64` | 0x0D | 64-bit float |
| `CHAR` | 0x0E | Unicode scalar |
| `STRING` | 0x0F | UTF-8 string |
| `BYTES` | 0x10 | Byte vector |
| `OPTION` | 0x20 | Optional wrapper |
| `VEC` | 0x21 | Dynamic array |
| `ARRAY` | 0x22 | Fixed-size array |
| `MAP` | 0x23 | Key-value map |
| `STRUCT` | 0x40 | Named struct |
| `TUPLE` | 0x41 | Tuple |
| `ENUM` | 0x42 | Sum type |

### Encoding Rules

r[schema.encoding.endianness]
All multi-byte integers in the canonical shape serialization MUST be encoded as little-endian.

r[schema.encoding.lengths]
String lengths and counts MUST be encoded as u32 little-endian.

**Primitives** (tags 0x00-0x10):
```
primitive_bytes = [tag]
```

**Option**:
```
option_bytes = [OPTION] || serialize_shape(inner_type)
```

**Vec**:
```
vec_bytes = [VEC] || serialize_shape(element_type)
```

**Array**:
```
array_bytes = [ARRAY] || length_u32_le || serialize_shape(element_type)
```

**Map**:
```
map_bytes = [MAP] || serialize_shape(key_type) || serialize_shape(value_type)
```

**Struct**:
```
struct_bytes = [STRUCT] || field_count_u32_le || (field_name_len_u32_le || field_name_utf8 || serialize_shape(field_type))*
```

**Tuple**:
```
tuple_bytes = [TUPLE] || element_count_u32_le || serialize_shape(element_0) || ... || serialize_shape(element_n)
```

**Enum**:
```
enum_bytes = [ENUM] || variant_count_u32_le || (variant_name_len_u32_le || variant_name_utf8 || variant_payload_bytes)*
```

Where `variant_payload_bytes` is:
- For unit variants: empty (zero bytes)
- For newtype variants: `serialize_shape(inner_type)`
- For tuple variants: `[TUPLE] || ...` (as above)
- For struct variants: `[STRUCT] || ...` (as above, with field count and fields)

r[schema.encoding.order]
Fields and variants MUST be serialized in declaration order. Order matters for compatibility.

### Example

For this Rust type:

```rust
struct Point { x: i32, y: i32 }
```

The canonical serialization is:

```
40                      # STRUCT tag
02 00 00 00             # field_count = 2 (u32 LE)
01 00 00 00             # field[0] name length = 1
78                      # field[0] name = "x"
09                      # field[0] type = I32
01 00 00 00             # field[1] name length = 1
79                      # field[1] name = "y"
09                      # field[1] type = I32
```

### Implementation Note

In practice, non-Rust bindings (Swift, TypeScript, etc.) can treat `sig_hash` as an opaque 32-byte value and embed it directly in generated code produced from the Rust registry. They do not need to reimplement the hashing algorithm unless you want a standalone implementation without Rust code generation.

The reference implementation of `sig_hash` computation is in `rapace-registry`.

## Handshake Protocol

When a connection is established, peers exchange a **method registry** keyed by `method_id`:

```rust
struct MethodInfo {
    method_id: u32,       // FNV-1a hash of "ServiceName.MethodName"
    sig_hash: [u8; 32],   // Structural hash of (args, return_type)
    name: Option<String>, // Human-readable, for debugging only
}
```

### Compatibility Check

r[schema.compat.check]
After exchanging registries, peers MUST check compatibility as follows:

| Condition | Result |
|-----------|--------|
| Same `method_id`, same `sig_hash` | Compatible, calls proceed |
| Same `method_id`, different `sig_hash` | Incompatible, reject calls |
| `method_id` only on one side | Method unknown to other peer |

### On Incompatible Call

r[schema.compat.rejection]
If a client attempts to call a method with mismatched `sig_hash`, the client MUST reject the call immediately (before encoding) with `INCOMPATIBLE_SCHEMA` error including method name and hash mismatch details.

### Collision Policy

r[schema.collision.detection]
If two different methods hash to the same `method_id` (FNV-1a collision), code generators MUST detect this at build time and fail with an error.

r[schema.collision.runtime]
Runtime `method_id` collisions are prevented by build-time detection. Implementations MAY assume no collisions at runtime.

## What Breaks Compatibility

### Struct Changes

| Change | Breaking? | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Reorder fields | ❌ Yes | Order is in hash |
| Add field | ❌ Yes | Field count changes |
| Remove field | ❌ Yes | Field count changes |
| Change field type | ❌ Yes | Type hash changes |
| Rename field | ❌ Yes | Identifier is in hash |
| Rename struct | ✅ No | Type name not in hash |

### Enum Changes

| Change | Breaking? | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Reorder variants | ❌ Yes | Order is in hash |
| Add variant | ❌ Yes | Variant count changes |
| Remove variant | ❌ Yes | Variant count changes |
| Change variant payload | ❌ Yes | Payload hash changes |
| Rename variant | ❌ Yes | Identifier is in hash |
| Rename enum | ✅ No | Type name not in hash |

### Method Changes

| Change | Breaking? | Why |
|--------|-----------|-----|
| Change argument types | ❌ Yes | Arg type hash changes |
| Change return type | ❌ Yes | Return type hash changes |
| Add/remove arguments | ❌ Yes | Arg count changes |
| Rename method | ❌ Yes | method_id changes |
| Rename service | ❌ Yes | method_id changes |

## Versioning Strategies

Since breaking changes require explicit versioning, Rapace encourages clear API evolution patterns.

### Strategy 1: Versioned Methods

Add new method versions instead of modifying existing ones:

```rust
#[rapace::service]
pub trait Calculator {
    // Original
    async fn add(&self, a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
    
    // New version with different types
    async fn add_v2(&self, a: i64, b: i64) -> i64;
}
```

Both methods coexist. Clients use whichever version they support.

### Strategy 2: Versioned Services

Create new service traits for major changes:

```rust
#[rapace::service]
pub trait CalculatorV1 {
    async fn add(&self, a: i32, b: i32) -> i32;
}

#[rapace::service]
pub trait CalculatorV2 {
    async fn add(&self, a: i64, b: i64) -> i64;
    async fn sub(&self, a: i64, b: i64) -> i64;
}
```

Server implements both; clients connect to whichever they need.

### Strategy 3: Envelope Types

For additive changes, wrap old types:

```rust
#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct UserV1 {
    pub id: u64,
    pub name: String,
}

#[derive(Facet)]
pub struct UserV2 {
    pub base: UserV1,           // Embed old version
    pub email: Option<String>,  // New field
}
```

This is NOT backward compatible (different hash), but enables gradual migration.

## Migration Workflow

When making breaking changes:

1. **Define new version** (`add_v2`, `ServiceV2`, `TypeV2`)
2. **Implement on server** (dual implementation)
3. **Deploy server** (serves both versions)
4. **Migrate clients** gradually
5. **Monitor old version usage**
6. **Deprecate old version** (log warnings)
7. **Remove old version** when safe

## Summary

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Default** | All changes are breaking |
| **Field identifiers** | Included in hash (renames break) |
| **Type names** | Excluded from hash (renames OK) |
| **Detection** | Hash mismatch at handshake |
| **Handshake key** | `method_id` (routing) + `sig_hash` (compatibility) |
| **Mitigation** | Explicit versioning (new methods/services) |

# Core Protocol

This section defines the Rapace core protocol: channel lifecycle, message flow, control messages, and the rules that govern communication between peers.

## Channels

A **channel** is a logical stream of related messages within a connection. Channels provide multiplexing: multiple concurrent operations share one transport connection.

### Channel Kinds

r[core.channel.kind]
Every channel MUST have a **kind** established at open time. The kind MUST remain constant for the lifetime of the channel.

| Kind | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `CONTROL` | Channel 0 only. Carries control messages (OpenChannel, CloseChannel, etc.) |
| `CALL` | Carries exactly one RPC call (one request, one response) |
| `STREAM` | Carries a typed sequence of items (application-level streaming) |
| `TUNNEL` | Carries raw bytes (TCP-like byte stream) |

### Channel ID Allocation

r[core.channel.id.allocation]
Channel IDs MUST be 32-bit unsigned integers.

r[core.channel.id.zero-reserved]
Channel 0 MUST be reserved for control messages. Neither peer SHALL allocate channel 0 for application use.

r[core.channel.id.parity.initiator]
The initiator (connection opener) MUST use odd channel IDs (1, 3, 5, 7, ...).

r[core.channel.id.parity.acceptor]
The acceptor (connection listener) MUST use even channel IDs (2, 4, 6, 8, ...).

Formula:
- Initiator: `channel_id = 2*n + 1` for n = 0, 1, 2, ... (yields 1, 3, 5, ...)
- Acceptor: `channel_id = 2*n + 2` for n = 0, 1, 2, ... (yields 2, 4, 6, ...)

This deterministic scheme prevents collisions in bidirectional RPC without any coordination.

r[core.channel.id.no-reuse]
**Channel ID reuse**: Each channel ID MUST be used at most once within the lifetime of a connection. This prevents late or duplicated frames from being misinterpreted as belonging to a new channel.

### Channel Lifecycle

```
                    ┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
                    │              CONTROL (ch 0)             │

```

r[core.channel.lifecycle]
Channels MUST be opened explicitly via `OpenChannel` on the control channel before any data frames are sent on that channel. A channel is closed when both sides have reached terminal state (both sent EOS, or CancelChannel received).

## Channel Opening

r[core.channel.open]
Channels MUST be opened by sending an `OpenChannel` control message on channel 0. A peer MUST wait until it has sent (as opener) or received (as acceptor) the corresponding `OpenChannel` before sending data frames on that channel.

### OpenChannel Message

```rust
OpenChannel {
    channel_id: u32,          // The new channel's ID (odd/even per role)
    kind: ChannelKind,        // CALL, STREAM, or TUNNEL
    attach: Option<AttachTo>, // For STREAM/TUNNEL: which call this belongs to
    metadata: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,  // Tracing, auth, etc.
    initial_credits: u32,     // Initial flow control credits (0 = no grant)
}

AttachTo {
    call_channel_id: u32,     // The parent CALL channel
    port_id: u32,             // Port identifier from method signature
    direction: Direction,     // CLIENT_TO_SERVER, SERVER_TO_CLIENT, or BIDIR
}

enum ChannelKind {
    Call = 1,
    Stream = 2,
    Tunnel = 3,
}

enum Direction {
    ClientToServer = 1,
    ServerToClient = 2,
    Bidir = 3,
}
```

### Validation Rules

r[core.channel.open.attach-required]
| Channel Kind | `attach` field |
|--------------|----------------|
| `CALL` | MUST be `None` |
| `STREAM` | MUST be `Some(AttachTo)` |
| `TUNNEL` | MUST be `Some(AttachTo)` |

r[core.channel.open.attach-validation]
When receiving `OpenChannel` with `attach`, implementations MUST respond as follows:

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| `call_channel_id` does not exist | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |
| `port_id` not declared by method | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |
| `kind` mismatches port's declared kind | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |
| `direction` mismatches expected direction | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |

r[core.channel.open.call-validation]
When receiving `OpenChannel` without `attach` (for CALL channels), implementations MUST respond as follows:

| Condition | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| `kind` is STREAM or TUNNEL (attach required) | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |
| `max_channels` limit exceeded | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ResourceExhausted }` |
| Channel ID parity wrong (e.g., acceptor using odd ID) | `CancelChannel { channel_id, reason: ProtocolViolation }` |

r[core.channel.open.cancel-on-violation]
All `CancelChannel` responses MUST be sent on channel 0. The connection SHOULD remain open unless the violation indicates a fundamentally broken peer (repeated violations may warrant `GoAway`).

### Who Opens Which Channels

r[core.channel.open.ownership]
The client MUST open CALL channels and request-direction stream/tunnel ports (client→server attachments). The server MUST open response-direction stream/tunnel ports (server→client attachments).

r[core.channel.open.no-pre-open]
Each peer MUST open only the channels it will send data on.

## CALL Channels

r[core.call.one-req-one-resp]
A CALL channel MUST carry exactly one request and one response. The client MUST send exactly one request frame with the `EOS` flag. The server MUST send exactly one response frame with the `EOS | RESPONSE` flags.

### Message Flow

```
Client                                          Server
   │                                               │
   │  DATA | EOS                                   │
   │  method_id = <method hash>                    │
   │  payload = request args + port refs           │
   ├──────────────────────────────────────────────▶│
   │                                               │
   │                         DATA | EOS | RESPONSE │
   │                         method_id = <same>    │
   │                         payload = CallResult  │
   │◀──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
   │                                               │
```

### Request Frame

r[core.call.request.flags]
Request frames MUST have the `DATA | EOS` flags set.

r[core.call.request.method-id]
The `method_id` field MUST contain the method identifier computed as specified in [Method ID Computation](#method-id-computation).

r[core.call.request.payload]
The payload MUST be Postcard-encoded request arguments, including `PortRef` values for any stream/tunnel parameters.

r[core.call.request.args-encoding]
If a method has multiple parameters, the request arguments MUST be encoded as follows:
- 0 parameters: encode `()` (empty payload)
- 1 parameter: encode the value directly
- 2+ parameters: encode a tuple `(arg0, arg1, ...)` in declaration order

### Response Frame

r[core.call.response.flags]
Response frames MUST have the `DATA | EOS | RESPONSE` flags set.

r[core.call.response.method-id]
The `method_id` MUST be the same as the request for correlation and routing.

r[core.call.response.msg-id]
The `msg_id` MUST be the same as the request's `msg_id` for correlation. See [Frame Format: msg_id Semantics](@/spec/frame-format.md#msg_id-semantics).

r[core.call.response.payload]
The payload MUST be a Postcard-encoded `CallResult` envelope (see below).

### CallResult Envelope

r[core.call.result.envelope]
Every response MUST use the following envelope structure:

```rust
struct CallResult {
    status: Status,
    trailers: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,
    body: Option<Vec<u8>>,  // Present on success, absent on error
}

struct Status {
    code: u32,              // 0 = OK, non-zero = error
    message: String,        // Human-readable description
    details: Vec<u8>,       // Opaque, for structured error details
}
```

This envelope provides:

- **Status**: Success or structured error (code + message + details)
- **Trailers**: Key-value metadata available after processing completes
- **Body**: The actual response data (only present when `status.code == 0`)

### Error Responses

r[core.call.error.flags]
Error responses MUST use the following format:

- **Flags**: `DATA | EOS | RESPONSE | ERROR`
- **payload**: `CallResult` with `status.code != 0` and `body = None`

r[core.call.error.flag-match]
The `ERROR` flag is a fast-path hint that mirrors the envelope status. Implementations MUST ensure the flag matches the envelope (ERROR flag set iff `status.code != 0`).

### Why One Frame Each Direction?

- **Simplicity**: No multi-frame state machines for call channels
- **Determinism**: EOS is always present, no ambiguity about "more messages coming"
- **Trailers without extra frames**: Status and trailers are in the response envelope
- **Streams do the heavy lifting**: Multi-message flows use attached STREAM channels

## STREAM Channels

r[core.stream.intro]
A STREAM channel MUST carry a typed sequence of items and MUST be attached to a parent CALL channel.

### Attachment Model

r[core.stream.attachment]
STREAM channels MUST always be attached to a parent CALL via a **port**. A STREAM channel without an attachment is a protocol violation.

```rust
// Method signature with stream arguments/returns
fn upload(meta: UploadMeta, data: Stream<Chunk>) -> UploadResult;
fn fetch(req: FetchReq) -> (meta: FetchMeta, body: Stream<Chunk>);
```

r[core.stream.port-id-assignment]
Each `Stream<T>` in the method signature MUST be assigned a **port_id** by codegen:
- Request ports (client→server) MUST use IDs 1, 2, 3, ... (in declaration order)
- Response ports (server→client) MUST use IDs 101, 102, 103, ... (in declaration order)

### Port References

In the request/response payload, stream positions are represented as port IDs:

- **Required stream**: `u32` (the port_id)
- **Optional stream**: `Option<u32>` (None if stream not used)

The actual channel binding happens via `OpenChannel { attach: AttachTo { call_channel_id, port_id, direction } }`.

### Message Flow

```
Client                                          Server
   │                                               │

   │◀──────────────────────────────────────────────┤
```

### Stream Frame Format

r[core.stream.frame.flags]
Stream item frames MUST have the `DATA` flag. The final item frame MUST have `DATA | EOS`. An empty stream MAY be represented by an EOS-only frame (no `DATA` flag).

r[core.stream.frame.method-id-zero]
The `method_id` field MUST be 0 for all STREAM channel frames.

r[core.stream.frame.payload]
The payload MUST be a Postcard-encoded item of the stream's declared type `T`.

### Empty Streams

r[core.stream.empty]
An empty stream (zero items) is represented by a single frame with `EOS` flag and `payload_len = 0`. The `DATA` flag MAY be omitted for empty streams.

### Type Enforcement

r[core.stream.type-enforcement]
The receiver MUST determine the expected item type `T` from:
1. The method signature (identified by `method_id` on the parent CALL channel)
2. The port binding (identified by `port_id` in the `AttachTo` attachment)

r[core.stream.decode-failure]
If payload decoding fails (type mismatch, malformed data):
- The receiver MUST send `CancelChannel` for the stream channel with reason `ProtocolViolation`
- The parent call MUST fail with an appropriate error status

### Ordering

r[core.stream.ordering]
- `OpenChannel` for required ports MUST be sent before or concurrently with the root request message
- Receiver MUST accept either order (network reordering happens)
- If request arrives but required port not yet opened, receiver waits until port opens or deadline hits

### Bidirectional Streams

r[core.stream.bidir]
For `direction = BIDIR`: both sides MAY send items on the same channel. Each side MUST send `EOS` independently (half-close semantics). The channel is fully closed when both sides have sent `EOS`.

## TUNNEL Channels

r[core.tunnel.intro]
A TUNNEL channel MUST carry raw bytes (TCP-like stream) and MUST be attached to a parent CALL channel.

### Semantics

r[core.tunnel.semantics]
TUNNEL channels use the same attachment model as STREAM (port_id, OpenChannel, etc.). The `method_id` field MUST be 0 for all TUNNEL channel frames. The `EOS` flag indicates half-close (exactly like TCP FIN).

### Raw Bytes (Not Postcard)

r[core.tunnel.raw-bytes]
TUNNEL payloads MUST be uninterpreted raw bytes, NOT Postcard-encoded. This is the only exception to Postcard payload encoding in Rapace.

r[core.tunnel.frame-boundaries]
Frame boundaries in TUNNEL channels are transport artifacts, not message boundaries. Implementations MUST reassemble frames into a continuous byte stream for the application. Applications MUST treat the byte stream as boundary-agnostic and implement their own message framing if needed. Payload size per frame is still bounded by the negotiated `max_payload_size`.

### Ordering and Reliability

r[core.tunnel.ordering]
TUNNEL frames MUST be ordered within the channel.

r[core.tunnel.reliability]
TUNNEL channels MUST use reliable, ordered delivery (e.g., WebTransport streams or equivalent). Lost or reordered frames would corrupt the byte stream.

### Flow Control

r[core.tunnel.credits]
Credits for TUNNEL channels MUST count raw payload bytes (`payload_len`):
- A frame with `payload_len = 1000` consumes 1000 credits
- EOS-only frames (no payload) consume 0 credits

### Use Cases

- Proxying TCP connections
- File transfer (when you don't want item framing overhead)
- Embedding existing protocols (HTTP/1.1, database wire protocols, etc.)

## Half-Close and Termination

### EOS (End of Stream)

The `EOS` flag means: "I will not send more DATA on this channel, but I can still receive."

r[core.eos.after-send]
The `EOS` frame MUST be the final DATA frame sent on that channel in that direction. The receiver continues processing until it also sends `EOS`.

### Channel States

For each direction (send/receive) on a channel:

| State | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `OPEN` | Can send/receive DATA |
| `EOS_SENT` | Sent EOS, waiting for peer's EOS |
| `EOS_RECEIVED` | Received peer's EOS |
| `CLOSED` | Both directions have EOS (or canceled) |

### Full Close

r[core.close.full]
A channel MUST be considered fully closed when:

- Both sides have sent `EOS`, OR
- `CancelChannel` was sent/received

r[core.close.state-free]
After full close, implementations MAY free channel state. Each channel ID MUST be used at most once within the lifetime of a connection (see r[core.channel.id.no-reuse]).

### CloseChannel

`CloseChannel` is an explicit teardown hint:

```rust
CloseChannel {
    channel_id: u32,
    reason: CloseReason,
}

enum CloseReason {
    Normal,
    Error(String),
}
```

r[core.close.close-channel-semantics]
`CloseChannel` MUST be sent on channel 0 and has the following semantics:
- Signals that the sender has freed its state for this channel
- **Unilateral**: No acknowledgment is required or defined
- **Optional**: EOS from both sides is sufficient for graceful close; `CloseChannel` is an optimization to free state earlier

### CancelChannel (Abort)

`CancelChannel` is an immediate abort:

```rust
CancelChannel {
    channel_id: u32,
    reason: CancelReason,
}

enum CancelReason {
    ClientCancel = 1,
    DeadlineExceeded = 2,
    ResourceExhausted = 3,
    ProtocolViolation = 4,
    Unauthenticated = 5,
    PermissionDenied = 6,
}
```

r[core.cancel.behavior]
Upon receiving `CancelChannel`, implementations MUST stop work immediately. They MUST discard pending data. They MUST wake waiters with an error.

r[core.cancel.idempotent]
`CancelChannel` MUST be idempotent (multiple cancels for the same channel are harmless).

r[core.cancel.propagation]
When a CALL channel is canceled, implementations MUST also cancel all attached stream/tunnel channels. When an attached channel is canceled, only that port is affected; the parent call MAY still complete if the port is optional.

## Call Completion

r[core.call.complete]
A call MUST be considered **complete** when all of the following are true:

1. Client has sent request `DATA | EOS` on the CALL channel
2. Server has sent response `DATA | EOS | RESPONSE` on the CALL channel
3. All **required** attached ports have reached terminal state:
   - For client→server required streams: server received `EOS` (or cancel)
   - For server→client required streams: client received `EOS` (or cancel)

### Optional Ports

r[core.call.optional-ports]
Optional ports MUST be handled as follows:
- If a stream port is optional (`Option<Stream<T>>`) and not used, no channel is opened
- The port_id field in the payload is `None`
- Call MAY complete without that port reaching terminal state

### Required Ports Not Opened

r[core.call.required-port-missing]
If a required port is never opened before deadline, the server MUST respond with a `FAILED_PRECONDITION` error status.

## Control Channel (Channel 0)

r[core.control.reserved]
Channel 0 MUST be reserved for control messages.

r[core.control.flag-set]
The `CONTROL` flag MUST be set on all frames with `channel_id == 0`.

r[core.control.flag-clear]
The `CONTROL` flag MUST be set only on channel 0. This redundancy allows fast filtering without inspecting `channel_id`.

r[core.control.verb-selector]
Control frames MUST use the `method_id` field as a verb selector from the table below.

### Control Verbs

| method_id | Verb | Payload |
|-----------|------|---------|
| 0 | `Hello` | `{ protocol_version, role, required_features, ... }` |
| 1 | `OpenChannel` | `{ channel_id, kind, attach, metadata, initial_credits }` |
| 2 | `CloseChannel` | `{ channel_id, reason }` |
| 3 | `CancelChannel` | `{ channel_id, reason }` |
| 4 | `GrantCredits` | `{ channel_id, bytes }` |
| 5 | `Ping` | `{ payload: [u8; 8] }` |
| 6 | `Pong` | `{ payload: [u8; 8] }` |
| 7 | `GoAway` | `{ reason, last_channel_id, message, metadata }` |

r[core.control.payload-encoding]
Control payloads MUST be Postcard-encoded like regular messages.

See [Handshake & Capabilities](@/spec/handshake.md) for the full `Hello` message format.

### GoAway

The `GoAway` control message signals graceful shutdown:

```rust
GoAway {
    reason: GoAwayReason,
    last_channel_id: u32,  // Last channel ID the sender will process
    message: String,        // Human-readable reason
    metadata: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,  // Extension data
}

enum GoAwayReason {
    Shutdown = 1,           // Planned shutdown
    Maintenance = 2,        // Maintenance window
    Overload = 3,           // Server overloaded
    ProtocolError = 4,      // Peer misbehaving
}
```

r[core.goaway.last-channel-id]
The `last_channel_id` field MUST represent the highest channel ID **opened by the peer** (not by the sender) that the sender will still process. The sender MUST complete work on channels with `channel_id <= last_channel_id` that were opened by the peer.

r[core.goaway.after-send]
After sending `GoAway`, the sender MUST:
- Continue processing existing calls on channels opened by peer with `channel_id <= last_channel_id`
- Reject new `OpenChannel` from peer with `channel_id > last_channel_id` using `CancelChannel { reason: ResourceExhausted }`
- Refrain from opening new channels itself
- Close the connection after a grace period (recommended: 30 seconds or until all accepted channels complete)

### Unknown Control Verbs

When a peer receives a control message with an unknown `method_id`:

r[core.control.unknown-reserved]
**Reserved range (0-99)**:
- The receiver MUST send `GoAway { reason: ProtocolError, message: "unknown control verb", last_channel_id: <current_max> }`
- The receiver MUST close the connection immediately after sending GoAway (no grace period for draining)
- This indicates a protocol version mismatch or buggy peer; continued operation is unsafe

r[core.control.unknown-extension]
**Extension range (100+)**:
- The receiver MUST ignore the message silently (no response)
- The connection continues normally
- This allows future extensions without breaking older peers

### Ping/Pong

r[core.ping.semantics]
Upon receiving a `Ping` control message, the receiver MUST respond with a `Pong` containing the same payload. The timing of ping initiation is implementation-defined (not mandatory keepalive).

Some transports (WebSocket) have their own ping/pong. Rapace-level ping provides application-level liveness checking across intermediaries that might not forward transport-level pings.

## Method ID Computation

r[core.method-id.intro]
Method IDs MUST be 32-bit identifiers computed as a hash of the fully-qualified method name using the algorithm specified below.

### Hash Algorithm

r[core.method-id.algorithm]
Implementations MUST use FNV-1a (Fowler-Noll-Vo) hash, folded to 32 bits:

```rust
fn compute_method_id(service_name: &str, method_name: &str) -> u32 {
    const FNV_OFFSET: u64 = 0xcbf29ce484222325;
    const FNV_PRIME: u64 = 0x100000001b3;
    
    let mut hash: u64 = FNV_OFFSET;
    
    // Hash service name
    for byte in service_name.bytes() {
        hash ^= byte as u64;
        hash = hash.wrapping_mul(FNV_PRIME);
    }
    
    // Hash separator
    hash ^= b'.' as u64;
    hash = hash.wrapping_mul(FNV_PRIME);
    
    // Hash method name
    for byte in method_name.bytes() {
        hash ^= byte as u64;
        hash = hash.wrapping_mul(FNV_PRIME);
    }
    
    // Fold to 32 bits
    ((hash >> 32) ^ hash) as u32
}
```

### Input String Format

r[core.method-id.input-format]
The hash input MUST be `"{ServiceName}.{MethodName}"` where `ServiceName` is the unqualified service trait name (e.g., `"Calculator"`) and `MethodName` is the method name (e.g., `"add"`).

Example: `"Calculator.add"` → method_id

### Reserved Method IDs

r[core.method-id.zero-reserved]
The value `method_id = 0` MUST be reserved for control messages (on channel 0) and for STREAM/TUNNEL channel frames (which are not method calls).

r[core.method-id.zero-enforcement]
**Enforcement**:
- Code generators MUST check if `compute_method_id(service, method)` returns 0
- If it does, code generation MUST fail with an error instructing the developer to rename the method
- Handshake MUST reject any method registry entry with `method_id = 0`

This reservation ensures unambiguous routing: `method_id = 0` always means "not an RPC method."

### Collision Handling

r[core.method-id.collision-detection]
Method ID collisions (different methods hashing to the same ID) MUST be detected at build time. If a collision is detected:
- Code generation MUST fail with an error
- The developer must rename one of the conflicting methods

r[core.method-id.unknown-method]
At runtime, if a peer receives a method_id it doesn't recognize, it MUST respond with error code `UNIMPLEMENTED`.

## Flow Control

r[core.flow.intro]
Rapace MUST use credit-based flow control per channel.

### Semantics

r[core.flow.credit-semantics]
Every channel has an inbound credit window (bytes the peer may send). The sender MUST limit payload bytes to at most the granted credit. The receiver grants credits via `GrantCredits` control message OR the `credit_grant` field in `MsgDescHot` (fast path, with `CREDITS` flag).

### Credit Grant

```rust
GrantCredits {
    channel_id: u32,
    bytes: u32,
}
```

r[core.flow.credit-additive]
Credits MUST be additive: if you grant 1000, then grant 500, the peer has 1500 bytes available.

### Default Mode

r[core.flow.infinite-credit]
Implementations MAY run in "infinite credit" mode:

- Grant a very large initial window (e.g., `u32::MAX`)
- Periodically top up as needed
- Protocol semantics remain the same

This allows simple implementations while preserving the ability to add real backpressure later.

### Credit Overrun (Protocol Error)

r[core.flow.credit-overrun]
If a receiver sees a frame whose `payload_len` exceeds the remaining credits for that channel, this MUST be treated as a protocol error:

1. Receiver SHOULD send `GoAway { reason: ProtocolError, message: "credit overrun" }`
2. Receiver MUST close the transport connection
3. Receiver MUST discard any frames that arrive after initiating close

Credit overrun is a serious violation because it indicates a buggy or malicious peer.

### EOS Frames and Credits

r[core.flow.eos-no-credits]
Frames with only the `EOS` flag (no `DATA` flag, `payload_len = 0`) MUST be exempt from credit accounting. This ensures half-close can always be signaled regardless of credit state.

### Why Per-Channel Credits?

- Different streams can have different flow characteristics
- File upload stream can be heavily windowed
- Small "progress/log" stream stays responsive
- Enables priority-based scheduling (grant credits to important channels first)

## Frame Reference

### MsgDescHot (64 bytes)

```rust
#[repr(C, align(64))]
pub struct MsgDescHot {
    // Identity (16 bytes)
    pub msg_id: u64,
    pub channel_id: u32,
    pub method_id: u32,

    // Payload location (16 bytes)
    pub payload_slot: u32,
    pub payload_generation: u32,
    pub payload_offset: u32,
    pub payload_len: u32,

    // Flow control & timing (16 bytes)
    pub flags: MsgFlags,
    pub credit_grant: u32,
    pub deadline_ns: u64,

    // Inline payload (16 bytes)
    pub inline_payload: [u8; 16],
}
```

### MsgFlags

```rust
bitflags! {
    pub struct MsgFlags: u32 {
        const DATA          = 0b0000_0001;  // Regular data message
        const CONTROL       = 0b0000_0010;  // Control message (channel 0)
        const EOS           = 0b0000_0100;  // End of stream (half-close)
        const _RESERVED_08  = 0b0000_1000;  // Reserved (do not use)
        const ERROR         = 0b0001_0000;  // Error response
        const HIGH_PRIORITY = 0b0010_0000;  // Priority hint (maps to priority 192)
        const CREDITS       = 0b0100_0000;  // Contains credit grant
        const _RESERVED_80  = 0b1000_0000;  // Reserved (do not use)
        const NO_REPLY      = 0b0001_0000_0000;  // Reserved: fire-and-forget
        const RESPONSE      = 0b0010_0000_0000;  // This is a response frame
    }
}
```

**Flag semantics**:

- `DATA`: Frame carries payload data
- `CONTROL`: Frame is a control message (MUST only be set when `channel_id == 0`)
- `EOS`: End of stream (half-close); sender will not send more data on this channel
- `ERROR`: Response indicates an error (MUST match `status.code != 0` in envelope)
- `CREDITS`: The `credit_grant` field contains a valid credit grant
- `RESPONSE`: Frame is a response to a request (not a request itself)

r[core.flags.reserved]
**Reserved flags**: Flags marked "Reserved" (prefixed with `_RESERVED`) are allocated but not yet defined. Implementations MUST leave reserved flags clear (unset). Receivers MUST ignore unknown flags unless the feature is negotiated as "must-understand" in handshake.

r[core.flags.high-priority]
**HIGH_PRIORITY flag**: This flag is a fast-path hint for binary high/normal priority. When set, it maps to priority level 192. When not set, priority defaults to 128 (or the per-call/connection priority if specified). Receivers MAY ignore this flag if they don't implement priority-based scheduling.

### Flag Combinations by Channel Kind

| Channel Kind | Request | Response | Stream Item | Final Item | Error |
|--------------|---------|----------|-------------|------------|-------|
| CALL | `DATA \| EOS` | `DATA \| EOS \| RESPONSE` | N/A | N/A | `DATA \| EOS \| RESPONSE \| ERROR` |
| STREAM | N/A | N/A | `DATA` | `DATA \| EOS` | N/A |
| TUNNEL | N/A | N/A | `DATA` | `DATA \| EOS` | N/A |
| CONTROL | `CONTROL` | N/A | N/A | N/A | N/A |

## Extension Points

The protocol includes extension points for forward compatibility:

1. **Reserved flag bits**: Unused bits in `MsgFlags` for future features
2. **Metadata fields**: `OpenChannel.metadata` and `CallResult.trailers` for key-value extensions
3. **Capability negotiation**: Handshake exchange of supported features (see [Handshake & Capabilities](@/spec/handshake.md))
4. **Status details**: `Status.details` for structured error information

New features are added by:

- Defining new capability flags
- Using metadata/trailers for optional data
- Reserving new control verbs (method_id on channel 0)

Old peers safely ignore unknown optional features. Unknown must-have features are rejected at handshake.


# Cancellation & Deadlines

This section defines how Rapace handles request cancellation and deadline enforcement.

## Overview

Rapace supports two mechanisms for limiting request lifetime:

1. **Deadlines**: Absolute time after which a request should be abandoned
2. **Cancellation**: Explicit signal to stop processing a request

Both mechanisms propagate to attached streams/tunnels and trigger cleanup of resources (including SHM slot guards).

## Deadlines

### Representation

r[cancel.deadline.field]
Deadlines MUST be carried in the `deadline_ns` field of `MsgDescHot`:

```rust
pub deadline_ns: u64,  // Absolute deadline in nanoseconds
```

| Value | Meaning |
|-------|---------|
| `0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF` | No deadline (wait forever) |
| Any other value | Absolute deadline timestamp |

### Time Base

r[cancel.deadline.clock]
Deadlines MUST use monotonic clock nanoseconds since an epoch. The epoch is established per-connection.

r[cancel.deadline.shm]
For SHM transports, implementations MUST use the system monotonic clock directly, as both processes share the same clock.

r[cancel.deadline.stream]
For stream/WebSocket transports, the sender MUST compute `remaining_ns = deadline_ns - now()` and the receiver MUST compute `deadline_ns = now() + remaining_ns`. This handles clock skew but introduces round-trip latency into the deadline.

r[cancel.deadline.rounding]
When converting between deadline formats: nanoseconds to milliseconds (for `rapace.deadline_remaining_ms`) MUST use floor division (round down) to ensure the receiver never waits longer than intended. Milliseconds to nanoseconds MUST multiply exactly (`ms * 1_000_000`).

r[cancel.deadline.expired]
If `remaining_ns` is negative or zero, the deadline has already passed. Senders SHOULD fail the request locally rather than transmitting it; receivers MUST immediately return `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`.

### Deadline Propagation

When a call has a deadline:

1. The deadline is set on the CALL channel's request frame
2. All attached STREAM/TUNNEL channels inherit the same deadline
3. If any operation on the call exceeds the deadline, the entire call fails

### Deadline Exceeded Behavior

r[cancel.deadline.exceeded]
When `now() > deadline_ns`:
- Senders SHOULD fail the request immediately rather than sending it
- Receivers MUST stop processing and return `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED`
- Attached channels MUST be canceled
- SHM slot guards MUST be dropped to free slots

r[cancel.deadline.terminal]
The `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` error MUST be treated as terminal. The call cannot succeed after this point.

## Cancellation

### CancelChannel Control Message

Cancellation is signaled via the `CancelChannel` control message on channel 0:

```rust
CancelChannel {
    channel_id: u32,
    reason: CancelReason,
}

enum CancelReason {
    ClientCancel = 1,      // Client explicitly canceled
    DeadlineExceeded = 2,  // Deadline passed
    ResourceExhausted = 3, // Out of memory, slots, etc.
    ProtocolViolation = 4, // Malformed frames, invalid state
    Unauthenticated = 5,   // Missing or invalid authentication
    PermissionDenied = 6,  // Valid credentials, not authorized
}
```

### Cancellation Scope

| Target | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| `CancelChannel(call_channel)` | Cancels the call AND all attached streams/tunnels |
| `CancelChannel(stream_channel)` | Cancels only that stream; call may continue if stream was optional |

### Propagation Rules

When a CALL channel is canceled:

1. **All required attached channels** are implicitly canceled
2. **All optional attached channels** are implicitly canceled
3. **Server MUST stop processing** the request
4. **Server SHOULD send** a response with error status (if not already sent)
5. **Client MUST stop waiting** for the response

When a STREAM/TUNNEL channel is canceled:

1. **That channel only** is canceled
2. **If the port was required**: The parent call fails with an error
3. **If the port was optional**: The parent call may still complete successfully

### Idempotency

r[cancel.idempotent]
`CancelChannel` MUST be idempotent. Sending it multiple times for the same channel has no additional effect. Implementations MUST handle duplicate cancellations gracefully.

### Cancel vs EOS

| Signal | Meaning | Data |
|--------|---------|------|
| `EOS` | Graceful end of stream | All data was sent successfully |
| `CancelChannel` | Abort | Discard pending data, stop immediately |

r[cancel.precedence]
A stream may receive `EOS` from one side and `CancelChannel` from the other. `CancelChannel` takes precedence—any pending data MUST be discarded.

## Cleanup Semantics

### SHM Slot Reclamation

r[cancel.shm.reclaim]
When a channel is canceled (or deadline exceeded):
- The receiver MUST drop all `SlotGuard`s for that channel
- Slots are freed back to the sender's pool
- Pending frames in the ring for that channel MAY be discarded without processing

This prevents slot leaks when requests are abandoned.

### Pending Writes

When cancellation is received:

| Transport | Behavior |
|-----------|----------|
| **Stream/WebSocket** | MAY continue to drain pending writes, or close immediately |
| **SHM** | MUST free slots; MAY leave descriptors in ring (receiver ignores them) |

The key invariant: **slot resources MUST be freed promptly on cancellation**.

### Ordering

r[cancel.ordering]
Cancellation is asynchronous. Implementations MUST handle the lack of ordering guarantees between `CancelChannel` on channel 0 and data frames on the canceled channel.

r[cancel.ordering.handle]
Implementations MUST handle all of the following cases:
- Data frames arriving after `CancelChannel`: these MUST be ignored
- `CancelChannel` arriving after `EOS`: this is a no-op (already closed)
- Multiple `CancelChannel` for the same channel: handling MUST be idempotent

## Client-Side Cancellation

Clients cancel requests by:

1. Sending `CancelChannel(call_channel, ClientCancel)` on channel 0
2. Optionally waiting for a response (server may send error status)
3. Dropping local state for the call

### Fire-and-Forget Cancellation

Clients MAY send `CancelChannel` without waiting for acknowledgment. The server will eventually process it and clean up.

### Cancellation Before Response

If the client cancels before receiving a response:
- Server MAY still send a response (client ignores it)
- Server MAY send an error response acknowledging cancellation
- Server MAY send nothing (client already moved on)

## Server-Side Cancellation

Servers cancel requests when:

1. **Deadline exceeded**: Server notices `now() > deadline_ns`
2. **Resource exhaustion**: Server is overloaded
3. **Shutdown**: Server is draining connections

### Graceful Shutdown Cancellation

During server shutdown:

1. Server sends `GoAway` to stop new calls
2. Server waits for grace period (or until all calls complete)
3. After grace period, server sends `CancelChannel` for remaining calls with reason `DeadlineExceeded`
4. Server closes the connection

The `DeadlineExceeded` reason is used because the grace period acts as a deadline. Clients receiving this error MAY retry on a different server.

## Error Status on Cancellation

When a call is canceled, the response (if sent) uses these status codes:

| Reason | Status Code | Retryable? |
|--------|-------------|------------|
| `ClientCancel` | `CANCELLED` | No (client chose to cancel) |
| `DeadlineExceeded` | `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Maybe (with new deadline) |
| `ResourceExhausted` | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Yes (after backoff) |
| `ProtocolViolation` | `INTERNAL` | No (bug) |

See [Error Handling](@/spec/errors.md) for the full error code table.

## Summary

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Deadline field** | `deadline_ns` in `MsgDescHot`, `0xFFFF...` = none |
| **Time base** | Monotonic nanoseconds; duration-based for cross-machine |
| **Cancel message** | `CancelChannel` on channel 0 |
| **Cancel scope** | Call cancels all attached; stream cancels only itself |
| **Propagation** | Automatic to attached channels |
| **Cleanup** | Drop slot guards, free resources promptly |
| **Idempotency** | Multiple cancels are safe |

# Error Handling

This section defines how Rapace represents and handles errors.

## Overview

Rapace distinguishes between:

1. **Protocol errors**: Malformed frames, invalid state, connection issues
2. **RPC errors**: Call failed with a status code (but protocol is fine)
3. **Application errors**: Business logic failures encoded in the return type

## Status Type

Every RPC response includes a `Status` in the `CallResult` envelope:

```rust
struct Status {
    code: u32,        // Error code (0 = OK)
    message: String,  // Human-readable description
    details: Vec<u8>, // Opaque structured details (optional)
}
```

### Status in CallResult

```rust
struct CallResult {
    status: Status,
    trailers: Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>,
    body: Option<Vec<u8>>,  // Present iff status.code == 0
}
```

r[error.status.success]
On success, `status.code` MUST be 0 and `body` MUST contain the response.

r[error.status.error]
On error, `status.code` MUST be non-zero and `body` MUST be `None`.

## Error Codes

### Code Ranges

| Range | Category |
|-------|----------|
| 0 | OK (success) |
| 1-49 | Standard RPC errors (gRPC-compatible) |
| 50-99 | Protocol/transport errors |
| 100-399 | Reserved for future use |
| 400+ | Application-defined |

### Standard RPC Error Codes

These codes are compatible with gRPC status codes for interoperability:

| Code | Name | Description | Retryable |
|------|------|-------------|-----------|
| 0 | `OK` | Success | N/A |
| 1 | `CANCELLED` | Request was canceled by client | No |
| 2 | `UNKNOWN` | Unknown error | Maybe |
| 3 | `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | Client sent invalid arguments | No |
| 4 | `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Deadline passed before completion | Maybe |
| 5 | `NOT_FOUND` | Requested entity not found | No |
| 6 | `ALREADY_EXISTS` | Entity already exists | No |
| 7 | `PERMISSION_DENIED` | Caller lacks permission | No |
| 8 | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Out of resources (memory, slots, quota) | Yes |
| 9 | `FAILED_PRECONDITION` | System not in required state | No |
| 10 | `ABORTED` | Operation aborted (e.g., concurrency conflict) | Yes |
| 11 | `OUT_OF_RANGE` | Value out of valid range | No |
| 12 | `UNIMPLEMENTED` | Method not implemented | No |
| 13 | `INTERNAL` | Internal server error | Maybe |
| 14 | `UNAVAILABLE` | Service temporarily unavailable | Yes |
| 15 | `DATA_LOSS` | Unrecoverable data loss | No |
| 16 | `UNAUTHENTICATED` | Missing or invalid authentication | No |
| 17 | `INCOMPATIBLE_SCHEMA` | Schema hash mismatch | No |

### Protocol Error Codes

| Code | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 50 | `PROTOCOL_ERROR` | Generic protocol violation |
| 51 | `INVALID_FRAME` | Malformed frame |
| 52 | `INVALID_CHANNEL` | Unknown or invalid channel ID |
| 53 | `INVALID_METHOD` | Unknown method ID |
| 54 | `DECODE_ERROR` | Failed to decode payload |
| 55 | `ENCODE_ERROR` | Failed to encode payload |

## Error Categories

### Protocol Errors

Protocol errors indicate a bug or misconfiguration. They typically close the connection.

**Examples**:
- Malformed frame (wrong size, invalid flags)
- Unknown channel ID in data frame
- Payload decode failure

**Response**: Close the connection. No retry.

### Transport Errors

Transport errors indicate network or I/O issues.

**Examples**:
- Connection closed unexpectedly
- Read/write timeout
- TLS handshake failure

**Response**: Reconnect and retry (if idempotent).

### RPC Errors

RPC errors indicate the call was processed but failed.

**Examples**:
- `NOT_FOUND`: Requested resource doesn't exist
- `PERMISSION_DENIED`: Caller lacks access
- `INVALID_ARGUMENT`: Bad request data

**Response**: Depends on error code (see retryability).

### Application Errors

Application errors are encoded in the response type, not the status.

```rust
// Application error in return type
async fn get_user(&self, id: u64) -> Result<User, GetUserError>;

enum GetUserError {
    NotFound,
    Suspended { reason: String },
    RateLimited { retry_after_secs: u32 },
}
```

The RPC status is `OK` (code 0). The error is in the response body.

**When to use application errors vs status codes**:
- Use **status codes** for infrastructure concerns (auth, rate limiting, unavailable)
- Use **application errors** for business logic (user suspended, invalid state)

## Retryability

### Retry Decision

| Code | Retryable | Notes |
|------|-----------|-------|
| `OK` | N/A | Success |
| `CANCELLED` | No | Client chose to cancel |
| `INVALID_ARGUMENT` | No | Fix the request |
| `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` | Maybe | Retry with new deadline |
| `NOT_FOUND` | No | Entity doesn't exist |
| `PERMISSION_DENIED` | No | Need different credentials |
| `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` | Yes | Backoff and retry |
| `ABORTED` | Yes | Retry immediately or with backoff |
| `UNAVAILABLE` | Yes | Backoff and retry |
| `INTERNAL` | Maybe | Depends on cause |
| `INCOMPATIBLE_SCHEMA` | No | Schema mismatch is permanent |

### Retry Strategy

For retryable errors:

1. **Exponential backoff**: Start with 100ms, double each retry, cap at 30s
2. **Jitter**: Add random jitter (±25%) to prevent thundering herd
3. **Max retries**: Limit total retries (e.g., 5)
4. **Deadline**: Respect the overall deadline

```
retry_delay = min(base_delay * 2^attempt, max_delay) * (0.75 + random(0, 0.5))
```

### Idempotency

**Idempotent operations** can be safely retried:
- Read operations
- Operations with client-provided idempotency keys
- Operations that check-and-set

**Non-idempotent operations** should NOT be retried blindly:
- Create operations (may create duplicates)
- Increment operations (may double-count)

Rapace does not enforce idempotency. Applications must design for it.

## Error Details

The `Status.details` field carries structured error information as an opaque byte vector.

### Normative Status

The `details` field is **application-defined**. The structure below is a **recommended convention**, not a normative requirement:

```rust
struct Status {
    code: u32,
    message: String,
    details: Vec<u8>,  // Opaque bytes; recommended: Postcard-encoded ErrorDetails
}

// RECOMMENDED structure (not normative)
struct ErrorDetails {
    // Retry information
    retry_after_ms: Option<u64>,
    
    // Debugging
    debug_info: Option<String>,
    stack_trace: Option<String>,
    
    // Structured cause
    cause: Option<ErrorCause>,
}

enum ErrorCause {
    QuotaExceeded { quota_name: String, limit: u64, used: u64 },
    RateLimited { requests_per_second: u32 },
    FieldViolation { field: String, description: String },
    // ... extensible
}
```

**Interoperability note**: If you use a different `details` format, receivers that expect the recommended format will fail to decode. For cross-organization APIs, document your error details schema explicitly.

r[error.details.populate]
Implementations SHOULD populate `details` for actionable errors.

r[error.details.unknown-format]
Implementations MUST gracefully handle `details` that is empty or contains an unknown format.

## Error Propagation

### From Server to Client

1. Server catches error during processing
2. Server encodes `Status` with appropriate code
3. Server sends response frame with `ERROR` flag
4. Client decodes `CallResult`, extracts `Status`
5. Client maps to language-appropriate error type

### From Attached Channels

If an attached STREAM/TUNNEL channel fails:

1. The channel is canceled
2. If the port was **required**: The call fails with an error
3. If the port was **optional**: The call may succeed without that port's data

### Cancel vs Error

| Situation | Status Code |
|-----------|-------------|
| Client canceled | `CANCELLED` |
| Deadline exceeded | `DEADLINE_EXCEEDED` |
| Server overloaded | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED` or `UNAVAILABLE` |
| Server shutting down | `UNAVAILABLE` |
| Stream decode failed | `INTERNAL` or `INVALID_ARGUMENT` |

## ERROR Flag

The `ERROR` flag in `MsgFlags` is a fast-path hint:

```rust
const ERROR = 0b0001_0000;
```

r[error.flag.match]
The `ERROR` flag MUST be set if and only if `status.code != 0`.

r[error.flag.parse]
Receivers MAY use the flag for fast error detection but MUST still parse `CallResult` for the actual status.

## Connection-Level Errors

Some errors affect the entire connection:

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Handshake failure | Close connection |
| Version mismatch | Close connection |
| Repeated protocol violations | Close connection |
| Authentication failure | Close connection (after error response) |

For these, send an error response (if possible) then close.

## Summary

| Aspect | Rule |
|--------|------|
| **Success** | `status.code == 0`, body present |
| **Error** | `status.code != 0`, body absent |
| **ERROR flag** | Must match `status.code != 0` |
| **Retryable** | `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`, `UNAVAILABLE`, `ABORTED` |
| **Not retryable** | `CANCELLED`, `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, `PERMISSION_DENIED` |
| **Application errors** | Encoded in response type, not status |
| **Details** | Optional structured info in `Status.details` |

# Metadata Conventions

This section defines standard metadata keys used in Rapace protocol messages. Metadata enables extensibility without protocol changes.

## Metadata Locations

Metadata appears in three places in the protocol:

| Location | Wire Type | Purpose |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| `Hello.params` | `Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>` | Connection-level parameters |
| `OpenChannel.metadata` | `Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>` | Per-call request metadata (headers) |
| `CallResult.trailers` | `Vec<(String, Vec<u8>)>` | Per-call response metadata (trailers) |

## Key Naming Conventions

### Reserved Prefixes

r[metadata.key.reserved-prefix]
Keys starting with `rapace.` are reserved for protocol-defined metadata. Applications MUST use a different prefix for custom keys.

| Prefix | Owner |
|--------|-------|
| `rapace.` | Rapace protocol specification |
| `x-` | Application-defined (not standardized) |
| (no prefix) | Application-defined |

### Key Format

r[metadata.key.format]
Keys MUST be lowercase kebab-case matching the pattern `[a-z][a-z0-9]*(-[a-z0-9]+)*` (e.g., `trace-id`, `request-timeout`, `x-custom-header`). Keys not matching this format are a protocol error and the connection MUST be closed.

r[metadata.key.lowercase]
Keys MUST be lowercase. Mixed-case or uppercase keys are a protocol error.

r[metadata.key.case-sensitive]
Keys MUST be compared as raw bytes (case-sensitive). Since all valid keys are lowercase, case normalization is not needed.

### Duplicate Keys

r[metadata.key.duplicates]
Senders MUST ensure all keys are unique within a metadata collection. If a receiver encounters duplicate keys, this is a protocol error and the connection MUST be closed.

This rule applies to `Hello.params`, `OpenChannel.metadata`, and `CallResult.trailers`.

**Rationale**: Strict duplicate rejection prevents ambiguity and injection attacks where a malicious intermediary appends keys.

## Value Encoding

Values are arbitrary byte sequences (`Vec<u8>`). The interpretation depends on the key:

| Value Type | Encoding |
|------------|----------|
| UTF-8 string | Raw UTF-8 bytes |
| Integer | Little-endian bytes (size is key-specific: 1, 4, or 8 bytes) |
| Binary | Raw bytes |
| Structured | Postcard-encoded struct |

**Note on integers**: Integer sizes vary by key. For example, `rapace.priority` uses 1 byte (u8), `rapace.ping_interval_ms` uses 4 bytes (u32), and `rapace.deadline` uses 8 bytes (u64). Always check the key definition for the exact encoding.

Standard keys (below) document their encoding explicitly.

## Standard Keys

### Distributed Tracing

These keys provide OpenTelemetry-compatible distributed tracing context.

#### `rapace.trace_id`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 16 bytes (binary)
- **Purpose**: Unique identifier for an entire trace across services
- **Format**: 128-bit identifier, typically hex-encoded in logs
- **Propagation**: MUST be propagated to all downstream calls

#### `rapace.span_id`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 8 bytes (binary)
- **Purpose**: Identifier for this specific span within a trace
- **Format**: 64-bit identifier
- **Propagation**: Each service creates its own span_id; parent span_id is `rapace.parent_span_id`

#### `rapace.parent_span_id`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 8 bytes (binary)
- **Purpose**: Span ID of the calling service's span
- **Propagation**: When making downstream calls, set this to your current span_id

#### `rapace.trace_flags`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 1 byte
- **Purpose**: OpenTelemetry trace flags (sampled, etc.)
- **Format**: Bit 0 = sampled (1 if trace should be recorded)

#### `rapace.trace_state`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: UTF-8 string
- **Purpose**: OpenTelemetry trace state (vendor-specific context)
- **Format**: Comma-separated key=value pairs

### Authentication

#### `rapace.auth_token`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata` or `Hello.params`
- **Type**: UTF-8 string (typically)
- **Purpose**: Bearer token or similar authentication credential
- **Format**: Application-defined (often JWT, API key, etc.)
- **Security**: SHOULD be used with encrypted transports

#### `rapace.auth_scheme`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata` or `Hello.params`
- **Type**: UTF-8 string
- **Purpose**: Indicates the authentication scheme
- **Values**: `bearer`, `basic`, `hmac`, application-defined

### Deadlines and Timeouts

Rapace has two deadline mechanisms with different scopes:

1. **`MsgDescHot.deadline_ns`** (frame field): Authoritative for protocol enforcement. Uses monotonic clock. See [Cancellation & Deadlines](@/spec/cancellation.md).

2. **Metadata keys** (below): For cross-service propagation through gateways/proxies.

#### `rapace.deadline_remaining_ms`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 4 bytes (u32 little-endian)
- **Purpose**: Remaining time budget in milliseconds
- **Use**: Cross-service deadline propagation (preferred)
- **Semantics**: Receiver computes local `deadline_ns = monotonic_now() + remaining_ms * 1_000_000`

This is the **recommended** key for deadline propagation because it handles clock skew.

#### `rapace.deadline`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 8 bytes (u64 little-endian)
- **Purpose**: Absolute deadline as Unix timestamp (nanoseconds since Unix epoch)
- **Use**: When wall-clock time matters (e.g., "complete by 3pm")
- **Semantics**: Server converts to monotonic for enforcement
- **Warning**: Subject to clock skew; prefer `deadline_remaining_ms`

#### Precedence

When multiple deadline sources exist:

1. `MsgDescHot.deadline_ns` (if set) is authoritative for local enforcement
2. `rapace.deadline_remaining_ms` is used for propagation to downstream calls
3. `rapace.deadline` is informational; implementation MAY ignore if `deadline_remaining_ms` is present

### Priority and Quality of Service

#### `rapace.priority`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: 1 byte (u8)
- **Purpose**: Request priority hint
- **Values**: 0 (lowest) to 255 (highest); default 128 (normal)
- **Semantics**: Hint only; server MAY ignore

| Value Range | Meaning |
|-------------|---------|
| 0-31 | Background/batch |
| 32-95 | Low priority |
| 96-159 | Normal (default: 128) |
| 160-223 | High priority |
| 224-255 | Critical/real-time |

#### `rapace.idempotency_key`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata`
- **Type**: UTF-8 string (max 128 bytes)
- **Purpose**: Client-generated key for request deduplication
- **Semantics**: Server MAY return cached response for duplicate key

### Transport Hints

#### `rapace.unreliable`

- **Location**: `OpenChannel.metadata` (for STREAM channels only)
- **Type**: 1 byte (bool)
- **Purpose**: Request unreliable delivery for this STREAM channel
- **Values**: 0 = reliable (default), 1 = unreliable
- **Semantics**: When set and `WEBTRANSPORT_DATAGRAMS` capability is negotiated, the transport MAY use WebTransport datagrams instead of streams
- **Constraints**: 
  - MUST NOT be set for CALL or TUNNEL channels (they require reliability)
  - Items may be lost or arrive out of order when enabled

### Server Information (Trailers)

#### `rapace.server_timing_ns`

- **Location**: `CallResult.trailers`
- **Type**: 8 bytes (u64 little-endian)
- **Purpose**: Server-side processing time in nanoseconds
- **Semantics**: Time from request receipt to response start

#### `rapace.retryable`

- **Location**: `CallResult.trailers`
- **Type**: 1 byte (bool)
- **Purpose**: Indicates if the failed request is safe to retry
- **Values**: 0 = not retryable, 1 = retryable
- **Use**: Set on error responses to guide client retry logic

#### `rapace.retry_after_ms`

- **Location**: `CallResult.trailers`
- **Type**: 4 bytes (u32 little-endian)
- **Purpose**: Suggested delay before retry (milliseconds)
- **Semantics**: Client SHOULD wait at least this long before retrying

### Connection Parameters

These keys appear in `Hello.params`:

#### `rapace.ping_interval_ms`

- **Location**: `Hello.params`
- **Type**: 4 bytes (u32 little-endian)
- **Purpose**: Suggested Rapace-level ping interval
- **Semantics**: Peer MAY send Ping at this interval; 0 = disabled

#### `rapace.compression`

- **Location**: `Hello.params`
- **Type**: UTF-8 string
- **Purpose**: Comma-separated list of supported compression algorithms
- **Values**: `none`, `zstd`, `lz4`, application-defined
- **Semantics**: Peers use intersection of supported algorithms

#### `rapace.default_priority`

- **Location**: `Hello.params`
- **Type**: 1 byte (u8)
- **Purpose**: Default priority level for all calls on this connection
- **Values**: 0 (lowest) to 255 (highest); if absent, defaults to 128
- **Semantics**: Applies to all calls unless overridden by per-call `rapace.priority` metadata or `HIGH_PRIORITY` frame flag

## Propagation Rules

### Request Metadata (`OpenChannel.metadata`)

| Key Pattern | Propagation |
|-------------|-------------|
| `rapace.trace_*` | MUST propagate to downstream calls |
| `rapace.deadline*` | SHOULD propagate with adjustment for local processing |
| `rapace.priority` | MAY propagate (service can override) |
| `rapace.auth_*` | MUST NOT propagate (authenticate at each hop) |
| `rapace.idempotency_key` | MUST NOT propagate (per-service scope) |
| `x-*` | Application-defined |
| Other | Application-defined |

### Trailer Metadata (`CallResult.trailers`)

Trailers are per-call and do not propagate. They are consumed by the immediate caller.

### Connection Parameters (`Hello.params`)

Connection parameters are per-connection and do not propagate.

## Size Limits

r[metadata.limits]
To prevent abuse and ensure efficient processing, implementations MUST enforce the following limits:

| Limit | Value | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| Max key length | 256 bytes | Per key |
| Max value length | 64 KiB | Per value |
| Max metadata entries | 128 | Per location |
| Max total metadata size | 1 MiB | All entries combined |

r[metadata.limits.reject]
Implementations SHOULD reject messages exceeding these limits with error code `RESOURCE_EXHAUSTED`.

## Binary vs Text Keys

Some systems distinguish binary and text metadata (e.g., gRPC's `-bin` suffix). Rapace does not:

- All values are `Vec<u8>` (binary)
- Interpretation is key-dependent
- Standard keys document their encoding
- Custom keys SHOULD document their encoding

For interop with systems that require text-only headers (e.g., HTTP gateways):
- Use base64 encoding for binary values
- Append `.b64` to the key name (e.g., `myapp.token.b64`)

## Reserved Keys (Do Not Use)

The following keys are reserved for future use:

- `rapace.version`
- `rapace.encoding`
- `rapace.signature`
- `rapace.encryption`
- `rapace.compression` (in channel metadata)
- Any key starting with `rapace.internal.`

## Examples

### Request with Tracing and Auth

```rust
OpenChannel {
    channel_id: 1,
    kind: ChannelKind::Call,
    attach: None,
    metadata: vec![
        ("rapace.trace_id".into(), trace_id_bytes.to_vec()),
        ("rapace.span_id".into(), span_id_bytes.to_vec()),
        ("rapace.parent_span_id".into(), parent_span_bytes.to_vec()),
        ("rapace.trace_flags".into(), vec![0x01]),  // sampled
        ("rapace.deadline_remaining_ms".into(), 5000u32.to_le_bytes().to_vec()),
        ("rapace.priority".into(), vec![160]),  // high priority
        ("rapace.auth_token".into(), b"Bearer eyJ...".to_vec()),
    ],
    initial_credits: 65536,
}
```

### Response with Timing

```rust
CallResult {
    status: Status { code: 0, message: String::new(), details: vec![] },
    trailers: vec![
        ("rapace.server_timing_ns".into(), 1_234_567u64.to_le_bytes().to_vec()),
    ],
    body: Some(response_bytes),
}
```

### Error Response with Retry Hint

```rust
CallResult {
    status: Status {
        code: ErrorCode::Unavailable as u32,
        message: "service overloaded".into(),
        details: vec![],
    },
    trailers: vec![
        ("rapace.retryable".into(), vec![1]),
        ("rapace.retry_after_ms".into(), 100u32.to_le_bytes().to_vec()),
    ],
    body: None,
}
```
