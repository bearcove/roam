//! Shared service definitions for rapace spec tests.
//!
//! These services are implemented by both:
//! - rapace-spec-tester (reference implementation)
//! - rapace-spec-subject (real rapace-core implementation)
//!
//! And used for codegen by:
//! - TypeScript
//! - Swift

// TODO: Define services using rapace::service macro
// For now, placeholder until we figure out what services the tests need

/// Placeholder - will add actual service definitions
